What have you learned this week?,,r/GenZ
r/GenZ Is in need of more moderators! Read below:,"In the past few months, we've been getting increased traffic to the subreddit and have been growing at a rapid rate. We have many dedicated moderators, but we have our own lives to live and cannot always be active.   


We need moderators who regularly participate in this subreddit. You will be expected to complete a high number of moderator actions every month. Moderator actions include removing messages, responding to modmails, etc. Your priority as a moderator here will be answering modmails, but you will also be expected to remove rule-breaking content and that such.  


We are accepting people without any prior moderation experience, however your chances of being accepted will be greatly increased if you're already a moderator for at least one similar sized or higher subreddit.   


You won't have access to every permission, but you'll have enough to be able to do what you need to do and to have fun moderating! If any of this seems interesting to you, feel free to respond to this post or DM me on Discord by clicking this [hyperlink](https://discord.com/users/297780427547213835)

Who else remembers Net Neutrality and when this guy was the most hated person on the internet for a few weeks,,r/GenZ
This sub lately.,,r/GenZ
You guys are absolutely pathetic,"Where do I even start? It's just constant complaining, constant astroturfing, constant shit flinging and constant apathy and pessimism.

Holy shit, get a life. I don't care if you guys get upset by this, but I swear I see people offering advice and trying to lift others up, and all they get met with is more negativity, pessimism and straight up insults. I get nonstop DM's from nobodies just trying to shit on faith, hope, positivity and advice that  I try to give.

Black pill this, virgin that, women this, economy that, boomers this, Politics that, hopelessness this, nihilism that.

I was happy at first to discover this sub because I could communicate with people my age since most of you have the social skills of a rock and are therefore online most of the time. My mistake, people here are absolutely pathetic, myopic and cynical, wanting to be perpetual victims instead of fixing their  own problems. You guys thrive and feed off negativity, you poor sacrificial lambs.

Of course, not all of you. I have met a few that are motivated, positive, well-adjusted and are genuinely kind people that I have learned from and I am grateful to them. Thank you to those who have enriched my mind and broadened my horizons with honest intent and in good faith.

But the overwhelming majority of you? Holy. Shit.

I am not even going to bother arguing with anyone here, I stopped trying to give advice and be positive, **even I started getting toxic** due to all the exposure to such shit these past few days and I have noticed it and will now put a stop to it. I don't want to leave bad comments anymore.  A lot of you can use some self reflection as well.

This sub is just full of losers, nihilists, perpetual victims and people who want to be offended in anyway shape or form. Chicken shits will argue with someone  online but afraid to tell their barber they don't like their haircut.

I don't care if you read this, but because the title is negatively worded, you probably clicked on it.

Good luck and get out of this sub, waste of time and deteriorates your mental wellbeing.

I'm going to actually go be someone, turning into one of these  chronically online redditors is an actual hellish nightmare to me, I don't want to be anything like you.

Goodbye.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 1: 1.6K views and 19 comments in less than an hour. I made a post similar in length but with a positive message last week. It only got 1 comment in 2 days. Decided to try this approach. Thank you for confirming that negativity is what drives engagement here. I am absolutely glad to be making this decision.

EDIT 2: This comment section proved it all, love it. Keep showing people how right this post it, keep showing people how GenZ can't read more than 4 sentences, keep showing how absolutely similar you all are, using the same tired out insults and the same responses. Keep showing how we all just complain and do nothing of it. Keep showing how this cycle of negativity will never break.  Anyone who sees this, should consider this a sign not to engage with this toxic subreddit.

Reader, do you want to be like people in this comment section? Go and do something with your life. 

Godspeed.

I full heartedly believe that this is caused by new parents just sticking a screen in front of their children to replace actually interacting with them. I see it everywhere, I can‚Äôt go to the store without a child on an iPad playing child YouTube videos at full volume. Don‚Äôt let this be your child. Please consider seriously limiting child screen time and don‚Äôt cave in to giving your child a device at such a young age.

Do you gamble?,"Hey folks! I'm 20 and wanted to hear what the wider community thinks about gambling. I've seen friends occasionally bet on sports, and it seems to make the games more thrilling for them. They say it adds an edge, even with small stakes. Which I understand, kinda. I gambled $20 and won a few hundred one time on Stake. But I haven't done it since. Personally, I'm on the fence. What's your take?

Where were you on 1/6/2021?,"I was on my college campus at the time just having finished my sociology class for the day. I also took the time while waiting for the first day of US History class to start to just meet some friends from my college. I saw on my phone that a bunch of Trumpists were invading the US Capitol, and the first thing that came out of my mouth was, ""Oh my God! This is so bad!"" 

I was indeed shocked at this, and I also felt like getting my popcorn out because it's not every day you see something as horrific as an insurrection in your home country. I was also constantly updating my classmates about every little thing that was going on that day. It was that insane.

I also find it weird how our first day of US History class happened as US history was being made. The teacher didn't talk about the insurrection, though we all knew what was going on that day. 

Even three years later, I sometimes cannot believe that this actually happened.",r/GenZ

So how do we navigate the internet now?,"I'm just glad that other people are realizing that all the search engines are broken now.  There's no more ""google it"" especially when you're talking to someone that doesn't know the search engine is broken and has gone from 15% ads in your first page of results to 60% ads, 30% AI-generated trash blog posts, 5% human-generated trash blog posts, and 5% answers to questions you didn't ask but potentially could lead you somewhere.. and that's on ALL the pages, not just the first page.  In 2014, we could hardly imagine needing to click past the first 2 pages of results. 

And now it suggests I just go search on Reddit. Great.  So we have to source our own answers from social medias and libraries and I guess however people used to navigate the internet before search engines made themselves ubiquitous and then DEGRADED their services so fast our heads were left spinning.",r/GenZ

I feel like I was lied to,"This is probably been said before, but I honestly just feel like my entire childhood was a lie and a whole world view that I constructed was false. 

I‚Äôm 22 years old and a recent college graduate in the United States. As a kid, I didn‚Äôt even question whether or not, I would go to college I assumed it was just what everyone did. I was under the impression that I would go to school, graduate, move out of my parents house and then get a job that would pay me enough to rent and then maybe buy a house in a couple years, find a wife have kids, etc.

I feel like all of those things are completely out of grasp. My degree gave me insurmountable debt and is 100% useless (political science) 99% of jobs that I have applied to have ghosted me. I am currently working as a personal trainer, but I make absolute shit pay and hardly get any hours, right now it‚Äôs averaging to 12k a year. Even if I do manage to get a job that pays something like $60,000 a year I don‚Äôt see how I could ever afford a house the way prices are now. That number is totally out of reach anyways though because there‚Äôs no such thing as an entry-level job. I see jobs paying 30-40,000 asking for masters degrees and five years of experience in the field. I literally don‚Äôt know how I can do anything with my life. 

Growing up with this idea that as long as I did certain things my life would go a certain way and then just having all of it be false has been really fucking annoying. I have no direction and no idea what to do going forward.",r/GenZ

I don't give a fuck about climate change and (school) shootings anymore.,"Let me preface this. I used to give a fuck. I was angry. I was angry at the politicians who sold our futures for wealth. I was angry at the NRA. I used to be scared. *What if my school was next? How much time do we have left before our planet dies?*

Year after year after year there's a new climate conference, a new shooting. A new G20 summit where all the world leathers gather and decide, once again that shit ain't to be done. A new shooting where (all)politicians talk about how sorry they are and they (all) agree how CHANGE NEEDS TO HAPPEN NOW!

But we wait. We wait and we wait and more schools get shot and more hurricanes happen and we venerate Taylor Swift as Time's Person of the Year despite the fact that she takes 170 private jet flights a year and emits more CO2 in a month than an average person will in their lives. But we should all buy electric cars and use paper straws, right?

I don't care anymore. If markets and terrorists were the last generation's problems, apathy is ours. Because I'm not only speaking for myself when I say that I don't give a fuck anymore. Whether I get shot and killed or I don't, it couldn't matter less if that's how I die. Nothing will change.

Help me make a rad charity app.,"Hey ya‚Äôll. So I‚Äôm a millenial and I‚Äôm getting into software development and working on an app I have an idea for that I think would be really cool and was hoping to get some feedback on it. 

Basically it would be an app that features a handpicked pre-vetted amazing org as a crowdfunding campaign that you could kick a few bucks to. Each campaign for run for 30 days and a new org would be featured the next month and so on.

Best part of all: 100% of the donations go directly to the org. App would be sustained with optional tipping/sponsorships. 

But I‚Äôm stuck on whether it should just feature one campaign a month or have a bunch of great orgs that you could discover and support. 

I like the idea of a community of users coming together to support one cause at a time together but I also see the possible benefit of featuring various campaigns at the same time that a user could pick from and those campaigns would always be there so whenever the mood strikes you can open the app, and throw a $5 or $10 or $20 to and carry on. 

If I had to choose I'd go with the first option: one charity/campaign a month. Simple and easy. 

But curious what you think? 

Could be real fun, we could even do a monthly giveaway/livestream trivia for users etc. 

And yeah I know we're all broke but the more users would mean the less everybody would need to donate to still make a big impact right? my $5 and your $5 and a thousand more and we can really do something worthwhile. ü´°",r/GenZ
I hate Snapchat,"I (19M) am on my last year of high school and everyday I am flooded with Snap messages.

I've tried asking for numbers or other socials (like Insta). But everyone in my school uses Snapchat and it's created a weird culture of being immediately available to whoever messages or calls you.


Why am I the weird one if I don't want to spend 20mins going back and forth spending pictures for streaks? Why am I the weird one if I disappear off of social media (including Snapchat) for a couple days? I'm going to sound like a boomer, but I kind of miss when 99% of my interactions with someone was in-person or over a once a week phone call. It's not that I hate talking to people, it's that it's draining to be at everyone's beck and call 24/7.

While I understand their reasoning, there are multiple studies that show the negative effects of early depedence to screens. As someone who is studying to become a teacher, it's been reported that many students struggle to pay attention or behave during classes. It's disheartening to see kids developing an addiction to technology so early in life, yet many parents do not even consider other ways of keeping their kids occupied, like coloring books, building blocks, or even picture books.

The people on TikTok wanting the kids obsessed with skincare to get chemical burns and other skin problems are messed up,"ICYMI gen Alpha is obsessed with skincare right now, and some of them are buying stuff like retinol and putting it on regularly without medical approval.

I keep on running across these videos on TikTok of people wanting these kids to get things like chemical burns because apparently some of these kids are being rude in places like Sephora and buying up all the products.

Most of the people posting the videos that I've seen appear to be millenials. They're just completely oblivious that it's mostly their generation who's raising these kids.

Honestly, the people posting these videos are most likely completely ignorant to how they behaved at that age, and it appears as if they never matured either.

I get that these kids are being rude, but to wish for them to get chemical burns and such is insane.

Also, some people have been saying that it's the responsibility of companies like Sephora and Drunk Elephant to tell people what the kids can put on their skin. I disagree with that because it's the parents' job to do that. It's also not Sephora's job to make the kids behave in the store, nor is it the responsibility of any company or influencer to not advertise a certain product; parents just aren't bothered to actually be aware of what their kids are watching.

I'm tired of people making those complaints when in reality the biggest issue here is lazy parenting, and parents being oblivious to skincare products, their ingredients and their effects even though their kids are using them. If your kid's putting something on their skin you should care about what it is and what's in it,  but unfortunately, some parents don't.",r/GenZ

first of all

gen alpha are kids

and second of all

millennials aren't doing anything wrong so therefore it's unjustified hate towards millennials for  giving their kids tech?

so fucking what?!

we have tech.

as long as the parents don't become to relyent on the tech for their kids, who cares?

Why Don't We Have 3rd Spaces?,"If any of you are on TikTok, then you might know about the discourse of little kids in Sephora and Ulta. Gen Z and Millennials alike are worried about what will happen to them in the future. They're ruining products, being rude af to workers who are Gen Z aged, and making things harder for retail workers there altogether.

I believe this is because of a couple things. Social media is the obvious. But other things I noticed: there is no tweenhood and 3rd spaces. Gen Alpha 10-14 have no spaces for themselves, which has led to them exploring the adult stores. Yet with them going into these stores, they're ruining shopping experiences for all but themselves. 

For example, we had Justice and that was great as a tween store. Claire's is still open but tweens don't go in because of products being ""distasteful"" and ""not in style."" People between 10-14 need to realize that it's OKAY to not look like these influences. They need to know it's OKAY to not be on social media at all until they're older. 

Now, I also realize it's parenting that is also a problem. Big time. But these parents are not going to listen until it affects them. Why? They're working to support their Gen Alpha kids or just...not paying attention. They need to open their eyes for sure, but I know I'll get some hate for that.

Solutions? Well, in order to not take away more spaces from children, Sephora, Ulta, and other department stores that notice more children have to put products in glass casing or ask to see an ID if they want to buy or even try a product. That is something immediate. Now, I've gotten flack about it because it restricts people from getting products, but IDing those trying to buy the harsher skin care products doesn't sound difficult, right?

Treat your college education like an investment,"If you are in higher education or thinking about higher education:

Treat your college education like an investment. Don't get caught with your head in the clouds and your thumb up your ass.

It is not always about passions. Nothing is guaranteed.

Think.

Anything is possible if you truly set your mind to it. But let's also be realistic, so many people just go after any degree ( which is good to have a degree) , without having a plan in place for what they are going to do in the future ( this is the problem).

For any degree, HAVE A PLAN. I know we may have passions for liberal arts ( which are very important for a society) and sciences (biology, chemistry , physics etc, also very important). However, going into debt for degrees that will require you to go into further education ( more expenses ) with the expectation that there will be a job for you is not smart, it is a badly calculated risk.

Some do great, but way too many graduates are not using their degrees as intended or unable to find jobs in their field with debt looming over them. This is a terrible situation all around.

Cover your ass, have a plan, get some hard skills along the way, have a good resume and portfolio and make connections.

Avoid debt as much as you can and if you take risks, calculate them carefully.

**Have. A. Plan.**

Everyone is arguing about the trans agenda or fucking drag queens or whatever when I could not give less of a fuck. The planet is dying why is that not what everyone is focusing on?

Like half the shit we buy is made with slavery or sweatshops or at the very least underpaid exploited workers, and yet nobody ever says anything because we all already know we just don't like thinking about it. 

Our school system was designed for a world that hasn't existed for nearly a century. You learn how to sit down, shut up and repeat information you will forget in a year because you didn't actually learn to understand it. You learn complex math but you don't learn how the fuck to file taxes. Our teachers are underpaid and overworked while administrators are overpaid.

Everyone is depressed but nobody looks for a solution, they give you drugs to treat the symptoms while the root causes remain ignored. 

The homeless in our own countries are all but completely ignored, and those in poverty around the world entirely neglected. Millions die of starvation and treatable diseases every year because they were born in the wrong spot on the planet.

Mass shooting are fake,"The title is a bit of satire but I‚Äôve been doing some research and would like to discuss with my fellow gen z homies. From what I‚Äôve found, the majority of mass shooting statistics are skewed and it really seems like it‚Äôs being done to push a narrative and create division. For example by definition (4 or more people shot) the majority of ‚Äúmass shootings‚Äù are done by black biological males. But most people contribute mass shootings to white males. What people who really dig into the topic will realize that the majority of ‚Äúmass shootings‚Äù are actually gang violence and not an act of terror such as a school shooting(which are predominately done by white biological males) . There were 350 school shootings in the US last year. But when you dig into the classification of a school shooting many statistics define a school shooting as any time a firearm was discharged on a school campus and these shootings do not follow the same definition as a ‚Äúmass shooting‚Äù. Yet the school shootings statistics are often added to the total of mass shooting, or at least mentioned in tandem. These ‚Äúshook shooting‚Äùstatistics do not take into account if anyone was injured, killed, if it was a college or grade school, or even if students were present at the school. If you filter all of that out and look at actual deaths and injuries  as a result of ‚Äúschool shootings‚Äù (defined as any shooting resulting in injury at or NEAR a school, a shooting on or near a property owned by a school, regardless of the intention of the shooter, so these statistics include gang related shooting along with acts of terror) there were 37 total events of a fire arm discharge resulting in injuries at or near a school in 2023. There were 20 deaths, 12 students and 8 faculty. And 40 people wounded by a firearm at a school. This is actually less than in 2022. When you compare the number of injuries or deaths to the number of ‚Äúschool shootings‚Äù the result is an average of 1.6 people injured or killed per event. You see that the majority of these shootings at school are not acts of terror but instead gang related, accidents, law enforcement pursuits that lead to school campuses, or straight up 1st degree murders. I say all of that‚Äôs to say this. The ‚Äúmass shooting‚Äù statistics are heavily skewed with very loose definitions. School shootings (in some statistics) will add to the total number of made shootings although they do not both meet the same criteria. This is pushing me towards the belief that this is done to incite fear and push a narrative. I‚Äôm not commenting on my opinion on gun control or how I think the problem should be addressed. All I want to do is to give you the straight facts to allow you to see that there are people out there who profit from your fear and want you to be scared.

elder gen z versus prime gen z,"i was born in 1999 and had a conversation with my friends born in 2004 (i got a late start in college, i‚Äôm a sophomore now so most of my friends were born 2003-2004) about shows we grew up on. i grew up on shows like wow wow wubbzy, the emperor‚Äôs new school, dave the barbarian, the buzz on maggie, my gym partner is a monkey, camp lazlo, american dragon jake long, etc. when i told them that, they had NO idea what most of those shows were. 

do any ‚Äúelder‚Äù gen z‚Äôs have the same issue? where relating to prime gen z‚Äôs/late gen z‚Äôs feels impossible sometimes?? (some argue 2005 isn‚Äôt ‚Äúprime‚Äù gen z, but in my experience it is). i feel like i relate more to people born in like 1993-1999 than i do with anyone born beyond 2005.  of course that isn‚Äôt true for everyone, but a good handful. 

i feel like generational gaps should be shorter. they can be anywhere from 15-20 years. what do i, a 24 year old, have in common with a 13 year old?!? i can relate with 18 and up, usually, but with anyone under 18 it can feel like i joined a tv show in the middle of season 5.

edited because i goofed on the year my friends were born lol

edit 2: for clarity, since i‚Äôve said this in the comments a few times; my older brother was born in 1993, and i grew up on everything he grew up on. literally. he always jokes about how he ‚Äúraised me on the stuff from the good ole days‚Äù. this is probably why i can relate to people closer to my brothers age. most of MY friends don‚Äôt have older siblings, and if they do their older siblings aren‚Äôt as old as mine is (mainly because i‚Äôm one of the oldest in my friend group). i‚Äôm not trying to claim every ‚Äò99 baby has this experience and i‚Äôm not trying to claim that anyone born after 2000 can‚Äôt have this experience. i just wanted to know if anyone else in the early years of gen z can relate to how i feel. 

edit 3: for fucks sake, people. i posted this to see if anyone else born 1996-1999 had similar feelings. i don‚Äôt know HOW it turned into a huge issue with my personal experiences, but god damn. i went ahead and changed the dates in the second paragraph from 2000 to 2005, because yes, there are people born between 2000 and 2004 who might have the same experiences as me (though i literally *never* said they didn‚Äôt). i‚Äôm done repeating myself in comments so if you read this whole post and still wonder ‚Äúhow does he relate more to people 6 years older than him???‚Äù, you can keep wondering. if you‚Äôre also in the early years of gen z and you relate to this post, awesome, that was my targeted question. have a great day.

Do you think that Gen Z will be better at raising kids in the digital age than other generations?,"Older Gen Z here (1996, I guess you could say I'm a ""zillenial""), but I feel like our generation may be the best to raise kids in the era of smart devices and social media.

The reason I say this is because many of us knew what it was like to grow up with social media and smart devices, but most of us didn't have them from an extremely early age to completely rewire our brains. I at least didn't get on social media or get my first smart device (iPod touch) until middle school, so I was able to have an early childhood without these in my life.

At the same time, we do have a good sense of how social media and being online all the time affects us at a young age, since we were the first generation to really experience this. I feel like we have a lot of lessons about this that we can teach our kids that our parents, and perhaps older millennial/gen x parents weren't able to do.

I‚Äôm afraid of Gen Z adopting the worst traits of millennials,"Let me preface this by saying I‚Äôm an inbetweener, so I‚Äôve had a foot in both generations. Because of it, I‚Äôve seen a lot of people older than me turn doomer, and retreat into layers of irony and futility. I‚Äôm starting to get worried Gen Z is following the same path.

It‚Äôs one thing to be cynical, hell I‚Äôm naturally inclined to it, and lord knows depression is going around these days. But the solipsistic nihilism gets to the point where it reinforces a self-fulfilling prophecy, to the point one almost get invested in things being bad so they can justify not caring, and not acting.  And that‚Äôs a pitiable way to live. One I‚Äôm starting to see more often in people younger than me, though not even close to the extent I‚Äôve seen in millennials.

There‚Äôs a natural part of growing up where you have to come to terms with the world: what it is, what it isn‚Äôt, what it could be, why it‚Äôs not, and how long it will take to get there. And not everybody has the resources or frame of mind to come out of that stronger than they went in. I was fortunate enough to have support, really good guidance and philosophy, and the challenge of chronic pain to force asking existential questions earlier than most.

Not everyone has to think the same way I do, I‚Äôm just concerned, because there are many people in our age group who are getting naturally disillusioned, and with the isolation and alienation modernity has brought, I really don‚Äôt wanna see a generation of people full of the conviction to be the ‚Äúman in the arena‚Äù (as Teddy Roosevelt referred to it), abandoning it all out of copium. Especially now, where the numbers and demographics might actually be there to meaningfully change things.

"According to the timeline a KGB agent gave in the 80¬¥s, GenZ should be the cause of the fall of the USA as democracy, because of ideological brainwashing that started 60 years ago. And you will not stop this fall.. even if you are faced with all the evidence. What do you think?","The timeline Yuri Bezmenov gave for total breakdown of a society without much interference, just using ""ideological subversion"" predicts that now we are in a state of crisis, a massive turn in ideology and politics is just around the corner. The whole process is described by him [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yErKTVdETpw).

""Bezmenov explained that the most striking thing about ideological subversion is that it happens in the open as a legitimate process. ‚ÄúYou can see it with your own eyes,‚Äù he said. The American media would be able to see it, if it just focused on it.

Here‚Äôs how he further defined ideological subversion:

‚ÄúWhat it basically means is: to change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that despite of the abundance of information no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interest of defending themselves, their families, their community, and their country.‚Äù

Demoralization is a process that is ‚Äúirreversible.‚Äù Bezmenov actually thought (back in 1984) that the process of demoralizing America was already completed. It would take another generation and another couple of decades to get the people to think differently and return to their patriotic American values, claimed the agent.

In what is perhaps a most striking passage in the interview, here‚Äôs how Bezmenov described the state of a ‚Äúdemoralized‚Äù person:

‚ÄúAs I mentioned before, exposure to true information does not matter anymore,‚Äù said Bezmenov. ‚ÄúA person who was demoralized is unable to assess true information. The facts tell nothing to him. Even if I shower him with information, with authentic proof, with documents, with pictures; even if I take him by force to the Soviet Union and show him \[a\] concentration camp, he will refuse to believe it, until he \[receives\] a kick in his fan-bottom. When a military boot crashes his balls *then* he will understand. But not before that. That‚Äôs the \[tragedy\] of the situation of demoralization.‚Äù

It‚Äôs hard not to see in that the state of many modern Americans. We have become a society of polarized tribes, with some people flat out rejecting facts in favor of narratives and opinions.

Once demoralization is completed, the second stage of ideological brainwashing is ‚Äúdestabilization‚Äù. During this two-to-five-year period, asserted Bezmenov, what matters is the targeting of essential structural elements of a nation: economy, foreign relations, and defense systems. Basically, the subverter (Russia) would look to destabilize every one of those areas in the United States, considerably weakening it.

The third stage would be ‚Äúcrisis.‚Äù It would take only up to six weeks to send a country into crisis, explained Bezmenov. The crisis would bring ‚Äúa violent change of power, structure, and economy‚Äù and will be followed by the last stage, ‚Äúnormalization.‚Äù That‚Äôs when your country is basically taken over, living under a new ideology and reality.

This will happen to America unless it gets rid of people who will bring it to a crisis, warned Bezmenov. What‚Äôs more ‚Äúif people will fail to grasp the impending danger of that development, nothing ever can help \[the\] United States,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúYou may kiss goodbye to your freedom.‚Äù

It bears saying that when he made this statement, he was warning about baby boomers and Democrats of the time.

In another somewhat terrifying excerpt, here‚Äôs what Bezmenov had to say about what is really happening in the United States: It may think it is living in peace, but it has been actively at war with Russia, and for some time:

‚ÄúMost of the American politicians, media, and educational system trains another generation of people who think they are living at the peacetime,‚Äù said the former KGB agent. ‚ÄúFalse. United States is in a state of war: undeclared, total war against the basic principles and foundations of this system.‚Äù

- No iPads at all
- Phone at 11-13 
- Social media only allowed at 13 and up (I was on social media before this age, but that was when it was not selling me products or being brainwashed)
- Reading and coloring like a normal kid when out to eat

Are there any egoists/individualists out there? Those who don't give a shit about pretty much any ideology whatsoever?,"I've seen some of the political posts there, and they're mostly about the mainstream narratives and politicians. 

I myself am a proud egoist, and first and foremost I care about my own interests. I don't associate with the ""Left Wing"" (even though there are many things I agree on with them), I do not call myself a ""Right Wing"" (while agreeing strongly with some of their views and values) and above all, I don't associate myself with ""The People"" (because I only see individuals, distinct persons, and any and all groups are abstract concepts which are beneath the Individual).

The civilization is a tool originally created to provide for the Sovereign Individual. That's it. A smart person once realized that individuals' personal activities can be organized and coordinated, to enhance productivity, and that's how we came up with empires and nations and guilds and companies and corporations and other collectives and organizations. And consequently, the only things I care about is whether a particular collective or organization is potentially beneficial for me, irrelevant to my goals, harmful, or an outright threat for me, the Sovereign Individual.

Consequently, I flag all the politicians as ""irrelevant"". They're just individuals who talk stuff, for the most part. Sometimes I agree or disagree with the stuff. 

Ultimately, whether their stuff matters or not, depends on the people. You can write a billion of fancy speeches, and keep writing, but if the people won't enforce any of the things in your speeches, they're powerless. You can declare everyone your slaves, and unless the people will obediently enforce your declarations, nothing will happen. You can create a Constitution and declare yourself a God-Emperor and everyone else your property, or write a law which tells you to wear an explosive collar which can be triggered anytime by anyone with relevant authority, and it'll be just a piece of paper.

That is, until the people will decide that wearing explosive collars is ""for the greater good"". Then, a significant supporter base appears, and the only thing that matters is whether they're powerful enough to force you to wear that damn collar. Whether the law enforcers will be able to overcome the resistance of those who don't wanna, and whether there will be any resistance at all, or if it will be, then how powerful and how able to defend itself.

Same shit with all politics. There is no ""greater good"", there is no ""right"" and ""wrong"". There are people who believe that no one should have wealth or abilities above a certain limit, and there are those who believe that a free person shall not be restrained in their ability to accumulate wealth and develop their own capabilities. There are those who believe in violently seizing stuff who dare to go above the limit and there are those who believe they should be peacefully shunned by the masses, instead. And there are those who believe they should be left alone. There are people who believe that you should follow a strict moral code and there are those who believe that you should have absolute freedom of self-determination and beliefs.

And no, there is no ""universal truth that everyone knows, and if they don't, then they're a sub-human and should be treated as a lowly animal"". There is the reality, which is absolute, and there are various interpretations of it. Depending on what things one does and doesn't know, and how they perceive a certain phenomenon, they build their own vision of the state-of-affairs around them (or sometimes borrow concepts from the others).

And if someone strongly believes I should support X or believe in Y or assume that Z is true/false, that someone should better be ready to prove their point, and shouldn't really count on me believing in their shit just because that position comes from an expert or specialist or any other ""reputable entity"". Actually, if you mention any sort of expert or any other reputation while trying to prove me anything, you're committing the appeal-to-authority fallacy. Which means, anything you say can reasonably be interpretted however I please.

And if that doesn't even concern me, don't even bother proving me anything. 

Some people behave inappropriately? Their problem, and sometimes I find it funny so buzz off. 

Some ""minorities"" are being ""oppressed"" somewhere and you want my sympathy? Dude, I'm the most oppressed minority on the earth, I am the Sovereign Individual and through the entire history of my existence, various communities and collectives tried to force me to do stuff on their behalf against my best interests. Unless you are a fellow Sovereign Individual or an entity actually willing to help me on mutually-beneficial terms, fuck off. 

Oh, you're about to scare me with the climate change, a deadly plague, the criminals, or divine wrath? Well, I'll just stand aside and watch the situation. If shit hits the fan, well, too bad, this universe doesn't exactly obey the wishes of human beings, unpleasant stuff happens. I'm going to handle the situation as I see fit and as for the rest, it's their responsibility. If nothing happens, well, it means you were either lying or mistaken. 

Oh, you claim that I'm the threat now, and demand that I comply with your directives? I know it well that if I comply with your orders, that would tell you that I'm the perfect target for subjugation, and hell no I am not surrendering my sovereignty to any of you. 

And you know it well that the real reason why you're trying to push that shit on me by force is not because you're ""right"", but because you believe to have overwhelming force coming from your numbers. You punks have been whining about lots of shit coming from the evil oligarchs and governments and the wealthy elites and the military-industrial complex and no one ever stood up to them and told them to comply with the Greater Good  or be punished. Because you know they'll fucking stomp you out of existence if you do as much as try. 

That's basically it. 20+ years and I'm living with exactly that position my whole life. While I've had strong sympathy towards certain particular movements, I've never tried to ""comply"" with anything I don't believe in. Where we agree, we agree and may work together towards certain goals. Outside of that, it's your problem.",r/GenZ

i have no ill intent making this either. this isnt to shame or anything like that, understand that we all got our opinions and disagreeing is cool, as long as you treat everyone w/ respect then i dont care. i despise people who go out of their way to mock someone for thinking a certain way or voting for a certain candidate or whatever, and i think its really sad that having civil discussions isnt very common (this goes for both sides, cause both are guilty of this lmaoo)

With all of the stuff coming out about the list of he who will not be named, with Katt Williams going on a podcast calling out celebs for being plants, I‚Äôm ready for celebrity culture to be over with.

These are imperfect people that have been put on a pedestal by rich a-holes for their entertainment and the amusement of others.

Ten year old girls at Sephora?,"The audacity of ten-year-olds today is insane. I‚Äôve seen all over social media about these ten-year-old girls who are buying retinals. There are groups of children about ten or twelve that are buying these extremely expensive skincare products that they don‚Äôt even need. I need to know which millennial parents are allowing their CHILDREN to buy these types of things in Sephora. From my point of view, I think it is absurd what these children are doing. I can already feel the pain of the Sephora employees who have to deal with them and the messes they make. These children are buying Drunk Elephant products which are almost fifty dollars a bottle. Most of these children already have perfect skin and are only applying products that are harming their skin. These little girls think that need skincare or full faces of makeup. They have seen all these influencers on social media doing grwm‚Äôs and automatically assume they need those products for their face. The fact they are buying retinals as well is insane. Most people don‚Äôt even start using retinal until they reach the age where you can see the aging on their face like thirty. Most twenty-year-olds don't even dream of putting retinal on their face because they are still young. We need to talk about this issue more. These children are also making ‚Äúsmoothies‚Äù in Sephora and emptying the testers which they don‚Äôt even bother cleaning up for. Many people over TikTok are furious about these issues and are blaming the parents. I agree with them because these parents are spoiling their children. They also are buying these glow recipes, Dior lip oils, rare beauty blushes, and harsh chemicals in general on their faces. I‚Äôve seen them coming in with Lululemon, Starbucks, and the newest iPhone as well. These ten-year-olds are growing up way too fast. I need to see one of these ten-year-olds get humbled because they are way too spoiled. When I was ten I didn‚Äôt even know what Sephora was. One time when I was at Sephora I saw a SIX-YEAR-OLD walk into Sephora with her dad asking for drunk elephant products. I‚Äôve also seen a twelve-year-old wear fake lashes to school. The amount of kids I‚Äôve seen posts on social media what they've gotten for Christmas is insane.  They get five hundred dollar Uggs, Stanley cups, Dior shoes, and more. Sephora has become the new claires for the ten-year-olds. They should not be allowed to buy things adults use, and Sephora can‚Äôt exactly ban ten-year-olds too. These children are jumping from princesses and ponies to skincare and makeup. When they do get it they are not even excited they act as if they don‚Äôt even care. The amount of Sephora employees that are fed up with these children walking into stores and selling out everything. From sunscreens to retinals I mean everything. We need to do something about it we can‚Äôt exactly just let children take over all these beauty brands as well.

"My thoughts on the Stanley cups, Uggs and Lululemon trend","As of recent I‚Äôve seen so many video of parents, siblings, parental figures whatever critic these items being loved by middle school and junior high aged girls and I honestly don‚Äôt understand the hate? We‚Äôve seen these items circulated through trends for almost 40 years now as of recent (I graduated in 2019)  remember and still own my hydro flask that I purchased during the ‚Äúvsco era‚Äù (that I dub the modern day beach bum) Uggs have been trending since I was in elementary and middle school and can remember girls 13 and older wearing PINK yoga pants and Uggs in the mid 2000s-early 2010s. If we wanna go further stationary such as thermos lunch boxes etc were popular among that same age group in the 80s and 90s and at the time girls wore slouch socks tucked into stirrup pants with oversized sweaters/sweatshirts. Sure young teens and girls don‚Äôt have as much pop culture catered towards them as much as they did in the 80s-2010s and their world isn‚Äôt as bright and colorful as it should be but  I don‚Äôt understand why are people acting as if young girls transitioning from princess and Barbie to Stanley‚Äôs and ulta is this new thing when that has been the natural transition for ages?

If you have an older sibling who is Gen Z, again similar rules as before, and born on the cusp (2010-2012), you are a Gen z.

This sub devolving into politics is inevitable,"I hate to be the one to say it, but the truth is this sub will become a political battleground until the election.
Regardless of political belief, in the elections of 2022 and 2023, our generations turnout was atypically high, and in some cases decisive. This has turned a lot of attention to our generation, and with it comes the desire to share politics, the desire to change politics, and (mostly) the desire to astroturf in a way to gaslight the impression of an apathetic consensus or to conflate parties among ‚Äúfellow kids‚Äù to try to lower voter turnout. 

Anyway, point is, this sub is like the RuneScape GF market: seemingly innocuous, but full of cynical imposters, transactional in their intent. Therefore, even if everyone acting in good faith were to shut the fuck up about politics, it wouldn‚Äôt work, and would only amplify the fake opinions. So we might as well embrace it. If people our age in the past were more engaged, maybe things wouldn‚Äôt have gotten so bad to the point it feels inescapable.

Edit: To be clear I'm not complaining, I have an old fashioned belief in involvement in the political process as a duty, and, no matter the circumstances, in doing what you can with what you have. This is just to point out to the people asking if we can give the politics a rest, that,  as evidenced by the ""fellow zoomers"" posting 2.5 seconds after this went up suggesting I'm ""GeNoCiDe JoE's Democratic party plant who's supporting killing Palestinians and grooming kids into trans cultural marxists"" no, in fact, we cannot.",r/GenZ

The thought of being closer to 20 than 30 makes me feel old and further that I'm closer to my late 20s than early 20s also makes me feel this age and I am supposed to see those in early 20s as kids and that makes me old. TBH I feel more like early to mid 20s than late 20s such as thinking about settling down or buying a house and stuff and that worries me that I'm immature and all for feeling this way. I see shows with people who are meant to be late 20s such as HiMYM or Big bang and how they act and i don‚Äôt feel that way and they seem older.  
For example this comic here tbh I don't relate to the late 20s part  
[https://9gag.com/gag/aRmxg7G](https://9gag.com/gag/aRmxg7G)  
and I worry it means I am emotionally stunted or held back.

  
3. I feel or worry this is the age where you are officially too old or too far removed from college/young adulthood fully and that makes me feel old or my youth is done. Like I feel I am firmly in mid to late 20s instead of early to mid 20s

  
4. I have not dated yet and trying but I wonder about my options. For example I was considering having 21 as my lowest but at this age I wonder if that makes me weird and creepy older guy who goes after younger women and all. Another thing is I worry about finding early 20s people such as say a 20 year old attractive like a celebrity and if I express or say even if I would not date and if this makes me a creep and the idea of being too old for college girls makes me feel odd.  
I remember back in HS this dude was 26 and dated a senior girl who was 18 and one of my friends who was 18 dated a dude at 28 who was a creep and I worry I am just like those guys for being fine to date 21 or even saying someone 20 is attractive. Also in uni I remember one of my friends dads said he wishes he was 20+ years younger due the women on my campus and I worry being attracted to 20+ upperclassmen at this age makes me again a creepy older man attracted or lusting after younger women which is a huge problem

  
5. I worry that this age is when you start to experience baldness or wrinkles in the face and other issues such as a dad bod

  
I have had these issues for a while and as its closer they are ramped up and I feel really anxious about the future",r/GenZ

"‚ÄúX grew up with Y, therefore bad‚Äù","*DISCLAMER* This is just my opinion, and I am aware I might be wrong. I strongly suggest you comment your thoughts.

I feel like the generation war argument of ‚ÄúX grew up with Y, therefore bad‚Äù is dumb.

Firstly, a lot of it is just bullshit. Most people don‚Äôt grow up with the newest, cutting edge technologies of their time. Most people rather grow up with the cutting edge technology of the previous generation, or past ~8 years. (Especially true if you have older siblings)

Secondly, if X really DID grow up with Y, does it even matter? I would say it depends from person to person. 

A gen Z who grew up always carrying their DS around and used it to avoid social interaction might have problems socializing as an adult. That is not good.

A gen Z who grew up always carrying their DS just for fun, or maybe even to play with someone else, is just gonna have a good time, no strings attached. That is good.

"Politics is life, there's no such thing as ""too political"" That's why we have free speech.","When roe v wade was struck down, I joke with my Republican friend at the time, what's going to be the status quo?, Don't talk about woman. That's too political? 

He laughed, he like the idea and thought I was joking, more and more he bought into the propaganda, we used to see eye to eye because we saw each other as a human and American first.


After Trump came back, he completely changed, he told me he was not gonna vote for him because he was dangerous since the January 6th incident.

I thought I knew him so we ended up still talking and joking around, the issue of immigrants came up, he stated strongly that we needed her strong border because of all the fentanyl that's coming in.


As soon as he said those key words, I knew I lost him.

After I told him that I wouldn't vote for Trump, he stopped talking to me, slowly but surely.


Around the time Trump started calling Biden a ""dangerous radical leftist"" our last conversation we had gone into an argument and I ended up basically telling him listen. I don't want to fight over politics.


He ended up saying, "" You're just a radical leftist"" 

And this is exactly what's happening.

We stopped being Americans were now radical leftist versus Trump, the Excellency.

Sowing The Seeds Of Love went #2, Break It Down Again hit #25, a remix of Mothers Talk charted at #27, and Woman In Chains got to #36, but all of those songs are forgotten/obscure outside maybe those from Gen X.

Is it fair to suggest that I grew up in the 2000s to some extent,"


I was born in April 2005. 

If you ask me what I remember from about 2008-2009, none of it is necessarily ‚Äú2000s‚Äù - they‚Äôre moreso just memories in regards to my family or very small things (I don‚Äôt really remember any phone usage. I remember riding around in a car with my maternal grandfather and parents while he played ‚ÄúFunkytown,‚Äù which is I think a 70s song. And I have a memory from preschool but that‚Äôs kind of it.) I also saw those 2000s magazine layouts on r/decadeology and thought ‚Äúoh yeah, I remember that! That does look familiar to me!‚Äù I used to see those when my parents would take me to the store. I also remember now that I had a Hannah Montana microphone set, like walking around with it 

I remember kindergarten or 2010 better. I remember the fire scene from Toy Story 3, that I saw it on a big screen in the theater (I don‚Äôt remember how I felt, but I imagine I probably remember this because it scared me.) I remember that my dad got the movie for me on DVD not long after (I have a memory of sitting next to him while he burned it for me on DVD, like a scene of Barbie and Ken.) I actually remember now that I had DVDs of Rugrats and that I watched ‚ÄúAll Grown Up‚Äù one morning before school with my brother in either 2009 or 2010 (it was the ‚ÄúRiver rats‚Äù episode that was playing.) I remember before we had a flat screen tv, we had one of those older ones and would watch nicktoons on them (but that‚Äôs a vague memory.) 

I remember having an iPad from about‚Ä¶ 6-8 maybe before I broke it (my grandparents bought it for me) and that I had a YouTube channel, but was way less reliant on the internet unless I had a question and actually probably spent way more time outside playing (when I think ‚Äú2012‚Äù it feels like the sun was always shining back then.) I remember my older brother and his friends played bay blades. I started using tumblr around 2015-2016, and remember seeing one of the first Steven universe episodes in 2013 (I was a big fan of the show even heading into middle school.) I remember my best friend and I watched family guy (though this probably started w my brother watching it, we mostly watched the 2000s eps) and that I was a big fan of classic Simpson‚Äôs. I also remember my best friend and I would watch Bart baker parodies (I realize now that I‚Äôm an adult that those were actually really offensive and mean spirited.) I remember actually watching regular show, Gumball, and one or two eps of adventure time when they used to air on Cartoon Network 

I grew up watching ‚Äúmean girls‚Äù so even though I‚Äôd totally dress like the women in that movie it‚Äôs hard for me to say that I‚Äôm ‚Äúnostalgic‚Äù over them. ‚ÄúMean Girls‚Äù def looks 2000s/dated, but it‚Äôs always been a rlly popular movie so I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôm ‚Äúnostalgic‚Äù over it exactly even though I remember watching it between 10-11. I regard 2010-2014 in a positive light, as having been a particularly good time, even though 2023 was also a good year for me.

I became obsessed with Stranger Things and the 80s after seeing the show for the first time in spring 2017, this obsession lasted from about 2017-2020 and involved seeing almost all the John Hughes films. I now think the 90s were ‚Äúcooler‚Äù but still struggle to get into the 2000s.

The earliest decade I had probably ever romanticized would be the 50s, due to the portrayal of them in Back to the Future

How many hours a week we have to work to afford four years of private college vs. in 1970,"It's no secret how much more costly higher education is for us compared to older generations but take a minute to comprehend how much. The cost of attending a private four-year college has gone up by **245%** from an average of $12,078 in the 1970s to $41,646 in 2021 *for one year.*

https://preview.redd.it/xhr4djoi14ac1.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41255114bd4e444e26b4a367214fc3a266daa531

Let's do a bit of math to really drive this point home. The average hourly wage in 1970 was $1.60. To pay for four years of college you'd have to work 4000 hours over 4 years. At 1000 hours a year that's 19.23 hours a week. *Less than a part time job.* 

The average hourly wage in 2021 is $10.99. To pay for four years of college you'd have to work over 15,000 hours over 4 years. That's about 73 hours a week. In other words, graduate with debt baby or don't graduate at all :)

We're all aware of the gap. It gets talked about in some form on a seemingly daily basis. It's depressing to think about so we don't. 

I graduated #1 in my high school class. Did the sports and dumb extracurriculars to look good. Took every AP class possible. I even had the fact that I was first generation, the youngest of five kids, and had two parents who barely graduated high school going for me and I still am going to graduate with debt I can't pay. I work two jobs while going to an in-state college. It took me 4 years to save up for just a used car and I'm struggling with maintaining it with the never-ending cost of repairs.

You probably have your own ""villain education arc"" but if I can get a little over 200,000 people to Venmo me (@TuitionTinCan) just a *quarter* ($0.25) I'd be incredibly grateful. Now I know that's a lot to ask of you. You'd have to sacrifice getting a gumball the next time you go to the mall, or a bouncy ball from Old Navy (if your local Old Navy still has one of those cool machines) and I don't have high expectations at all about this, but I will be grateful for every quarter I receive no matter what. At the end of the day, I made my choice, and I will graduate with debt, but maybe you can relate and help soften the blow. ",r/GenZ

I would love to meet a woman who has a deep understanding of me, and we are able to grow our relationship into something based on love and respect. Eventually I would want to have kids, and to be able to provide for them and show them great things about life. I would want a nice big family.

I would want to grow old with my wife, and know that I did everything I possibly could,  taking myself to my limits , that I never took things for granted and that I could pass on with a smile and no regrets.

Do you believe that America is in late stage capitalism? ( Americans only)," While I am not a communist and don't think it will ever happen but even if Marx was right then I still don't think America is in late stage capitalism because to get to that point most Americans would be living in 3rd world conditions and have little to no luxuries because income inequity would be so extreme that income inequity in todays America would be seen as a joke. I think if Marks was right then it would take a long time before America really ever gets to late stage capitalism.

This is actually a rlly interesting topic in my opinion bc I‚Äôve always noticed how huge 50s and 80s nostalgia were. In regards to 80s nostalgia, which was obviously way more recent, I think that the fact that Boomers, Millennials, and Gen X all were likely to have nostalgic memories of the 80s helps (younger Boomers would have been in their twenties at some point in the 80s, Gen X-ers would have been elementary school aged at youngest or in their teen years-twenties at oldest, Millennials could technically have some memories of them as pre schoolers or elementary schoolers. I think that that‚Äôs why they‚Äôve lived on, bc the ages of about 5-twenties are oftentimes super nostalgic for people. I also wanted to mention this to introduce a potential reason as to why 80s nostalgia blew up so much)

Gen Z (24F) with younger zoomer siblings. Advice needed.,"TLDR: my sister is selfish and I wanna know if you'd say something to her if you were in my shoes. Idk if it's my place. 

I'll try to keep it as concise as possible. TW: mention of recreational cough syrup use as well as hard drug use as a minor. 

I'm eldest of several children. You can assume I was parentified at an early age and internalized my role as big sister, it became a personality trait. I lo-o-o-ve those kids. 

My younger sister, next eldest, just turned 18, and she is the concerning one. It involves our 16-year old sister. This story I need advice on is just IMO the most egregious thing you can do to a little sibling. 

(18 year old we will call Cassie, 16 will be called Ally.

Cassie and Allie have always had a special relationship as two sisters closest in age in the family. Cassie has been seeing her boyfriend for over a year now. The sisters share a room so Ally has to accommodate often despite them sharing a space. 

Well, I got a call from my mother a few months ago saying Ally was in the ER awaiting placement at a mental institution. I was shocked and terrified she was bipolar like me. Anyway, my mom told me she was caught trying to shoplift cough syrup with whatever ingredient it is that can potentially get you high. I was floored, Ally would NEVER.

Ally awaited a bed in a facility for 8 days, all of which she spent in the hallway as her original ER room was then given to more important cases. My baby sister was in the ER for 8. DAYS. Then a 3 week stay at the facility. Now she is missing out on educational opportunities, to which she is very devoted, because she's in a mandatory IOP (intensive outpatient) program. Not to use this old term but Ally truly IS a cinnamon roll of a human so I was perplexed as to why she would ever even think about that kind of drug use.

Well. Recent trip home and I find out Cassie was in the car outside the drug store while her boyfriend and Ally went inside. Boyfriend directed my 16 year old sister to put the bottle of medicine in her bag and they began to walk out. Security came up to them and the boyfriend kept walking and got into the car with Cassie as Ally was reprimanded by security.

He fucking walked away. I could kill him.

Well, you'd think an older sister and 18 year old would know that that was awful, but my sister Cassie is still seeing this guy. Ally accidentally let slip that the boyfriend had a pill problem including stealing prescription drugs from his parents. My mom is livid, Ally is hurting at the hands of her own best friend as they'd always been close but Cassie has turned cold. She seems to almost relish having mommy and daddy issues as it makes her quirky. She makes empty promises and takes more than she gives. I feel like I'm losing the sweet Cassie who Ally and I grew up with to this bad ass boyfriend who she won't drop. 

*I need to know if I should send her a tough love letter laying out her actions and betrayal to her sister.*

That's the tip of the iceberg. Fuck if anyone wants to chat I'd appreciate it. Comments or DMs.",r/GenZ

Anyone else I only feel more or less comfortable hanging out with in a group setting with one of my close friends present. 

I can hang out with totally new people if I‚Äôm in a new place, but generally this is how it is at home and it was this way in college. Anyone I was loosely friends with or knew in my past I have no connection to anymore. I literally hang out with one person alone every week.

I go to sleep at 1-2am and wake up at 6-7am on college days and weekends and holidays I sleep around 1-2am and wake up around 10-11am. I have acne around my corners and the sides of my head. Around a year ago, I started developing a little beard. I‚Äôve seen some people talk about inner thigh with hair could mean it‚Äôs over. I don‚Äôt have a single hair in my inner thigh and my arm hairs are quite short. Also my right and left side big teeth have not fallen out if it correlates to anything.

As it stands (at least for right now), all the social security that takes up so much of my paycheck will never come back to benefit me, I have to pray every day that my car won‚Äôt die on me so i can keep working. If I ever had to go to the ER, i‚Äôll be i know i will be in debt forever. Is it really worth it to stick it out and wait for America to ever get their shit together or is it more advantageous to just move somewhere else and start a life there? I know this is super pessimistic, i just don‚Äôt really see much point in working 55 hour weeks just to pay rent and bills and just exist, hoping that one day things will get better.

I can't even look at nostalgic stuff anymore without thinking that I wss too young during something,"Just yeah, one thing that sucks about being a early 2007 born who is class of 26 is that I wss too young for alot of things,I. Was in elementary school for almost all of the lare 2010s and in middle school for almost all of the early 2020s, I was affected by covid alot only being a 6th grade and it sucks because in 2019 I was only just now becoming an actual person in a sense I actually started to make friends and I had a YouTube channel I made videos and they were actually somewhat decent for my age but I was only 12 in the last good year (2019) so I deleted my channel over some drama and now I'm really unproductive today like in some ways I was more productive 4 years ago then today and I haven't made any irl friends since and I wish I was at least in high school during covid so I could of just grown a bit more. I wish I was class of 2022 or 2023 tbh like they got to be in elementary school for the  full early 2010s and were in middle school by the time all the shit in 2016 happened and got to start high school pre pandemic when things were better. Like just idk covid had it effects like last year I had a class of mostly seniors and junior (class of 2023 and 2024) and they were alot more chill then most people in my grade and even with age my bus goes from 6-12th grades and I remember back in 6th grade the high schoolers were alot more mature on the bus then the ones now and yeah probably cause of covid cause like it gets even more immature every year atp like class of 2027 are freshman now and they are somehow way worse then us like already and the middle schoolers on the bus now legitimately act like 10 year olds. Idk just it's another reason I envy older birth years as I been doing for years and I guess lately I shifted from just years themselves to more just grad years since that probably matters more in alot of ways which is why I envy early 2005ers+ 2004ers and 2003ers alot even if the former is only 2 years older then me but threeschools years away and given all the changes over time, they had a completely different middle and high school experience. Idk this is just a problem that only gets worse with time with no solution and overall just yeah I feel like I can't relate to the people I wish I was the same age as.....",r/GenZ
When did you stop watching disney channel?,"I just was browsing YouTube, watching nostalgic christmas specials from early/late 2000s and I stumbled upon an upload of a Good Luck Charlie episode.

the episode was a collab of GLC with Jessie, i didn't even know this episode existed, and it has charlie talking and shit. it's so shocking because i could've sworn i watched the entire show, but apparently I only watched until about 2013. 

so I realized I was about 12 when I stopped watching disney channel (as much as I used to as a kid).

What should I do?,"So when I was a senior in high school, my mom would take my money because she felt like I wasn‚Äôt going to graduate since I would skip school for a few days. I graduated from high school and still haven‚Äôt received the money that she has took. She tells me that she‚Äôs ‚Äúsaving‚Äù it for me but in my head, how could you be saving the money for me when you took my money out of spite? One day she has a conversation with me saying I owe 300 a month for bills since I flunked out of college the past year and remained home just working. But the thing that doesn‚Äôt sit right with me is, why would I give you money when you still have the money you claim you‚Äôre ‚Äúsaving‚Äù. Literally graduated from high school and you still have my bread. Tomorrow I am opening a new bank account because I don‚Äôt want her taking from me knowing that she still has my money. I‚Äôm aware of having responsibilities but the thing is, how would you feel if someone who took from you, is still asking you to give them money? If she hadn‚Äôt taken my money out of spite, me giving her 300 for bills wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. I‚Äôve even tried asking for a portion of my money back and she still tells me no. All I want to know is, am I wrong for not giving her money? I need y‚Äôall‚Äôs opinion on this‚Ä¶",r/GenZ

My almost 25 year old brain is having a hard time fathoming why kids aged 6-10 are looking at gore and porn, and other very adult (and things even as a adult I want nothing to do with or see) things, what happed to childhood innocence?

The 2010s decade,"Idk why but I feel like the early 2010s just felt extremely different from the late 2010s. Like in the early 2010s, dvds, digital cameras, 7th gen consoles, flip phones, frutiger aero, 2000s Disney, Cartoon Network, and Nickelodeon shows were all still very popular until around late 2013. Target still had those colorful carpets and those eating places were they served popcorn and designs overall were more daring and expressive.

I‚Äôve literally never known a time when I had genuine joy or positive mental health. I‚Äôve been depressed, sad, and lonely since the 6th grade. I literally have zero social interactions or a group of people I could call to hang out. I literally do not even know where to go to make friends or find a GF or get laid.

Is porn addiction real?,"This seems to be a highly debated topic both online and in the scientific community.

In my opinion, porn addiction is real, and it's effects on the brain are serious and documented. Desensitization, meaning nothing excites you anymore besides pornography, erectile dysfunction , the inability to form relationships with the opposite or same gender depending on your orientation, increased physical standards, cognitive impairment, anxiety , depression. There is a lot more.

My experience as a 22M, so many of us have normalized this stuff, it is not normal, I can see the damage it is doing to us.

The reason I want to ask this question is because I want to see where  GenZ stands on the issue. Pornography in the past consisted of photos, drawings and magazines. But with high-speed internet and endless options, I feel like pornography is major issue that isn't talked about enough.

Maybe it is shame? Maybe it is a taboo topic? Maybe it is because some do not believe that it is a problem? I do not know what stops us from tackling and talking about this issue.

I figured with New Years approaching, people may have it in their resolutions to kick this habit to the curb.

I want to be positive about this and focus on my future and what i can do but all this wars, oil consumption, wildfires and famines just don't let. I want to be wrong about this but i just dont know anymore.

I do want to say that we only have ourselves Gen Z and as long as we stick together is always going to be us against evil politicians who want to silence us on real world problems.

I feel like I wasted money even though I used a gift card that was a Christmas present to pay for something.,"One of my dad's friends gave me this gift card for Christmas. The gift card was multi-brand (Gap &amp; Old Navy, apparently they are part of the same company) and I went to Gap's website and they had expensive stuff. The card was $50 USD and I was able to buy two pairs of socks and three boxer briefs. It felt like I was scammed even though I used a gift card so technically, my dad's friend bought them.

I then went to look at what Old Navy had and it was like 1/3 of the price! But by the time I saw that, I already paid for the Gap stuff and it was preparing to ship. I do plan on wearing the Gap stuff because I technically got it for free, but I could have got more for free if I went to Old Navy and I would have shopped at Old Navy if I knew. If I paid for it with my own money, then I would be returning it.

Now, I'm not the type of guy to spend lots of money on clothes. I buy $30 jeans and $5 t-shirts with no logo. However, $50 for 3 days worth underwear is crazy. So if I had to choose between Old Navy and Gap, I'm choosing Old Navy. I learned the hard way.",r/GenZ

Childhood stories. I'll start.," Idk what flair to use.

I'm just gonna make a short list of some memorable episodes from my childhood:

1. The time I had to hit my dad over the head with a baseball bat to stop him from beating the shit out of my mom.
2. My mom routinely screaming at me until 1:00 am because neither of us could figure out common core math homework and I would get in trouble at school if I didn't do it *exactly* how my math teacher told us to.
3. The day my dad left. Neither my mom or I could sleep that night with the sudden absence of the sound of him stomping around the house all night. Also because he took the box of laundry powder, two guns, and intentionally left bills unpaid before he left to screw my mom over.
4. The time I read an entire chapter of tom sawyer aloud in class without struggling to pronounce basic words and everyone but the two other smart kids started staring at me like I was an alien.
5. Getting bullied by the local upper crust kids to the point of having nightmares and nothing being done about it because they were good at football and "" I know their parents and they didn't raise them like that. "" or ""I know them they wouldn't do that""
6. One of my bullies told the police I had threatened to shoot up the school and was bragging about it. (He never had any consequences for this.)
7. Dropping out of school. (currently trying to get my GED)
8. The moment I realized/found out that I'm not the supergenius gifted kid everyone told me i was growing up, but that I just went to school with a bunch of morons.",r/GenZ

Do you wear Vans shoes?,"Asking as a Millennial from the Uk;

Here in England, we've sadly lost many of Van's stores over the past year in big shopping areas such as Brighton, Bristol and Southampton.

The stores themselves were relatively small, always had lovely customer service. The brand itself seems to get rarer and rarer to notice in public. I've always regarded Vans as being a timeless vintage name similar to Converse. It's a real shame how it seems to be physically disappearing from the high street.

Gen Z Timeline for a 2023 senior,"as an american senior in high school that lives like 20 minutes from a major city, i thought i would just put down every major point in my life (both positive and negative) that i can remember. this is just for those that are not gen z and hopefully by putting this out i dont feel like alone w this

\- living during a recession during your first 10 years of life and seeing the effects of it/the toll it had on people older than us. we were basically born into a time where a lot of ppl were frantic about losing their job which gave us the idea that any job can be taken away from us

\- Facebook, YouTube, Instagram alreaady being a thing ever since I entered elementary school. Snapchat being introduced a year later. Probably what makes a lot of us so insecure/anxious bc we've been exposed to that environment of judging everyone based on looks at an extremely young age by tenfold compared to previous generations

\- Being reminded that climate change would have to be fixed by us CONSTANTLY

\- News being more accessible as ever causing us to never really have a sense of innocence that previous generations had

\- we still played with pokemon cards and shopkins. fidget spinners came and were gone as soon as they were introduced. 

\- Being introduced to those certain sites that show videos of people who are taken from the earth accidentally while trying to look up information about something unrelated on the family computer when i was in 2nd grade

\- Being introduced to another certain site that showcases nudity in video form on my school soccer field by my friend on his phone a year later during 3rd grade

\- Being subjected to listen to anything Taylor Swift put out during late 2014/early 2015 as a young kid (her music isnt bad dont get me wrong)

\- The entire trump saga and witnessing so much racism/as well as the fact that majority of my school was hispanic and came from immigrants so we were all scared that we and or our friends &amp; family would be deported at 5th grade

\- Solar Eclipse happening 6th grade, most of us weren't allowed to watch it happen unless you brought solar glasses from home (our school didnt have enough funding to let us all experience it together) so the most we got to watch was the classroom turn dark for a little and then go back to normal

\- Lockdown hitting 8th grade, never got my 8th grade trip (or a refund w the money my mom deposited for it), culmination being digital, seemed like everyone was more focused on the adults rather than the kids, social media use went up so much more and it feels like we haven't recovered from that

\- completely online 9th grade

\- return to high school 10th grade, masked up the entire year, almost no school events, and from what i saw everyone was a lot less social

\- first normal year of school after covid was my 2nd to last year of high school

\- the multiple teacher strikes that occured (twice in middle school, once in high school so far)

college is on the horizon and i genuinely do not have the motivation to go. whats the point when it looks like a recession is on its way and i cant even afford having a chance at living on my own unless its with 3 other people in an apartment someone else owns

&amp;#x200B;

some things i've also noticed that i don't think really fit the timeline but i still want to bring up:

\- mental health is a lot more common to talk about now

\- everyone I know apart of gen z generally feel a sense of hopelessness. this could be due to being born into a world where you're constantly being watched, don't know if you'll get made fun of on a public platform where potentially millions can laugh at you as well, and the fact that living comfortably is a privilege and not a right

\- almost all of us were told growing up that if we left our house we would get snatched by a predator

\- most of our life has been spent online

\- schools are cheaping out by giving us chromebooks with chrome os (VERY limited compared to windows) instead of operating systems actually used in the workforce causing younger gen z to regress in tech skills

\- along with the fact that tech/typing classes are being taken out

\- eating disorders being glorified/more common (the toxic gym culture in gen z especially with the younger males, the whole edtwt culture that came from tumblr, wieiads to stay skinny on tiktok)

\- a lot less shame in liking anything that isnt mainstream)

\- being able to spy on anyone in 3 taps

\- gen z seems to have a much more prominent fear of being a bother/annoyance compared to previous generations

\- we want to label ourselves more and more because we crave attention from social media and want more eyes on us. the more we label ourselves, the more we cater towards others that are potentially like us. how can you blame us when it's MUCH more easier to receive attention from the whole world than ever?

\- more performative activist than ever. you'll see someone post about a war and then the next day at school overhear them saying they don't really care what happens about the war (which when you've been subjected to hearing about wars and wars and death and death and the whole world just seems like a bad place to live in ever since you stepped out of the womb can you blame them?)

\- we're possibly the last generation to grow up watching cable tv unless a streaming collapse happens which seems more likely every day by the way these companies operate on greed rather than customer satisfaction and actually believing in their product

\- lots of us just do not want anything to do with cars and are trying to avoid it as long as possible. they're expensive and can break down at any given moment on top of the fact that insurance is so mind bogglingly expensive that it feels like theres no point in even owning one just because of the risk that it can break the next day

RFK Jr is ahead for GenZ,"If we elect him as our next president, he will do so much good for our environment. This guy has been a warrior, fighting against polluters and greedy corporations. 

I think he gets a bad rap as an anti vaxxer. He supports vaccines, but wants them to be double blind placebo tested, just like all other medicines. It's weird that they aren't tested that way. Japan has excellent health outcomes with only a fraction of the mandated vaccines. But even if you aren't on board with his vaccine view, please just look at his record fighting corporate greed. 

I've watched a ton of videos and listened to a bunch of podcasts, and I came away with a sense that he will work for all of us. I don't agree with all of his views, but I know his heart is in the right place. 

I care about the environment, and I care about how our government is being overly influenced by corporate interests.

"Do you think subcultures died/are dying? (stuff like emo, goth, punk, grunge, skaters, bikers etc')"," Ive  heard something really interesting earlier today, its like a theory so  its not necessarily happening but its something ive felt and it makes  alot of sense. One of the last subcultures to come out is emo and that  was like what more than 20 years ago? i dont count stuff like the e-kids  thing since it feels more like a general aesthetic and doesnt have much  that ties it together but even if u do thats still like 10 years plus  right?

So the theory ive heard is  that bc subcultures were kind of a anti mainstream thing people latched  onto them for a unique and separate identity, and also to find similar  people, usually subcultures have a few central interests and beliefs  that connect them together. Subcultures are always more of a teen thing,  so im not talking about the 40 year olds who go on the emo cruises

Nowdays  bc of the tiktok algorithm the mainstream doesnt exist, every one is  seeing a different reality right? if i see a goth video that has 2  millions views, i might think its mainstream, but it really isnt since  it was given out specifically for people who are interested in it.  Having no mainstream makes subcultures obsolete, theres no reason to  strive to be unique when ur already in your own niche specific community  and every one else is also unique

To  add on that everything is in reach, i for myself have listened to a  shit ton of goth music, and so can anyone else, i dont need to go to a  specific record store that has niche unique music, i can go on spotify  and play any album id like. Not to complain thank god i can listen to  whatever i want but that takes away some of the specialness subcultures  have, if anyone is able to participate its not as much a badge to show  your personality but more of a title u can stick anywhere

Personally  this fucks with me bc id actually think on a usual basis that everyone i  know would get the same content i consume and would know it already, bc  its my subjective mainstream. Like if u saw a band u like a bunch of  times on a playlist spotify custom made for you and got a band shirt  from them assuming everyone else would recognize it

Dating is hard,"For many first generation immigrants, like me, our parents forbade us from having romantic relationships in fear that it would lead to accidental pregnancies or interfere with our studies, etc. Because of this I have never pursued any of the few crushes I‚Äôve had in the past; I never thought that to be an option.

I‚Äôve stopped caring now that I‚Äôm older, especially now that I‚Äôve seen my older siblings get into relationships. However, talking to men with the intentions of dating them is extremely awkward for me. I‚Äôm not very good at flirting, I cringe every single time. I‚Äôm now realizing that starting off as friends with a man, then naturally developing feelings for them may be the best option for me. 

Dating apps are honestly a waste of time for people my age who are trying to date within their age range(18-20). Many of them are looking for hookups or a short term relationship, which I don‚Äôt see the point in. Why waste your time getting to know someone if you have no intention of being with them long term? 

Anyways excuse my yapping. I‚Äôm just wondering if any other first generation immigrant with traditional parents can relate and how‚Äôve you combat this? How is dating for you? 

For you normal people of my generation, how easy do you find dating in terms of building a romantic connection, or flirting, etc? How are your experiences with dating apps?

  Also, I really do think that, 2006 and 2007 kids had a far better childhood than us 2004 kids. Don't get me wrong , the early 2010s were pretty sweet and all, but the mid to late 2010s (specifically 2016 to 2019) were faaar better imo.

Everything sucks now because people have lost hope and have quit trying. Sure, one vote may not matter, but when millions have that attitude is when the problem starts.

DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE

Millennials &amp; Gen Z Uniting at Rock Bottom.,"I came across an intriguing idea and wanted to hear your thoughts:

""Society has forced Millennials and Gen Z to be stuck together because we are already at rock bottom together.""

 Anything worse would be a cyberpunk dystopia. This concept really struck a chord. 

It feels like Millennials and Gen Z are co-pilots in navigating a storm of economic turmoil, environmental challenges, and rapid tech shifts. There's a weird sense of solidarity in facing these hurdles together, But here's a twist: being at rock bottom might also be our launch pad. 

Perhaps this collective adversity is our chance to team up, get creative, and forge a future that's not a cyberpunk horror story, but a narrative of hope and innovation. 

So, what's your take? Are we truly at rock bottom, and can we use this to leap towards positive change? Or are we just dramatizing our generational struggles?",r/GenZ

Do I actually seem likely to eventually have a child?,"
I was born on April 5th, 2005. I already know - can say with confidence - that I am *not* having a child between 2024-2031. I will not be having a child around then. I am personally aiming to give birth at 28 at earliest (2033) and 35 at latest (2040. Well, maybe 2041 at absolute latest, but I have *never* wanted to give birth at 35 or older due to the potential health complications so what we‚Äôre really aiming for here is 2033-2039. I would want to have some more money saved up, I presently have a little over $6,000 from a part time job I officially started on July 31st and I know I‚Äôll work more often starting January 8th, so I guess I‚Äôll see (I‚Äôm a substitute teacher, and I like working with the kids. 2023 has been a great year for me.) I make $17 hourly, we‚Äôll see what happens in the new year. 

The earliest decade I recall romanticizing would have been the 1950s, even though I am a black woman and understand that life back then would have been very difficult. This happened, I‚Äôd say, because I was a huge fan of ‚ÄúBack to the Future‚Äù in elementary school (just the first two films, I didn‚Äôt see the third one until later on.) I wanted to build my own Time Machine and everything, my best friend and I were convinced that we could. I remember noticing how the fashion and hairstyles of the characters in the film in 1955 greatly differed from the fashion and hairstyles of 1985, and noticing the slang as well. I understand now that things weren‚Äôt really clean and perfect in the 1950s, but I remember thinking of it as having been that way at some point in my lifetime, just because of how things were portrayed in the media. I remember liking songs such as ‚ÄúRockin Robin‚Äù at one point. The last time I had any sort of real fascination with the 50s was in middle school.

I would later on grow obsessed w stranger things in spring 2017. I stayed home from school to watch the second season (did same thing w volume 1 of season 4) and this year for Christmas my parents actually bought me a stranger things backpack (and the parents at my job who are apart of the teacher appreciation committee bought me a stranger things coloring book.) my stranger things obsession sparked my 80s obsession, I really liked 80s coming of age films from about 2017-2019 (‚Äúbreakfast club,‚Äù ‚Äúpretty in pink,‚Äù ‚Äúsay anything,‚Äù the list goes on and on. But I also liked ‚Äúthe goonies‚Äù and was particularly curious abt Winona Ryder.) Around 2021 I had grown sick of the 80s obsession and actually found adter rewatching the breakfast club that I no longer liked it at all. If asked to dress up now like a celebrity from a specific decade I‚Äôd probably choose the 90s, maybe the 70s (I‚Äôve been rewatching clips/eps of that 70s show and still enjoy it.)  

I remember 2010-2014, maybe up until 2015, as a good time. I became depressed at some point in 2014, but this happened almost sort of naturally, no one did anything to me then or harmed me, I just had an existential life cross at the age of nine. I remember angry bird, having an iPad and YouTube channel around 6-9 but still spending a lot of time running around outside, seeing those very 2000s-looking magazines at the store (there‚Äôs a specific layout, it was on r/decadeology and I thought ‚Äúoh, I remember that‚Äù,) watching clips of songs from films like ‚Äúsinging in the rain‚Äù and ‚Äúsound of music‚Äù bc of our music teacher, seeing Toy Story 3 in theaters (the scene where they‚Äôre all in the fire is the one that sticks out in my mind) and my dad getting it on DVD after. I used to watch Rugrats all the time too. Those are things I remember from my childhood. Oh, and I became a huge Steven universe fan in 2015 

My mother still smokes cigarettes (1972 born) so I‚Äôm used to the smell. I‚Äôve seen both my parents and my older brother too actually )born December 1999) smoke cigarettes - my older brother is in rehab. My parents were at their healthiest up until about 2017 (my mother, at least, my father is a noticeably off alcoholic) and ever since then my mother has been rather aggressive, has officially lost her looks, and is just a very unhealthy person overall. In 2019 my brother went to a mental hospital temporarily. I‚Äôd say this yr has been much better in comparison

I have gotten hemorrhoids a lot within the last yr don‚Äôt deal w them well

"If you're a lonely guy, it's NOT YOUR FAULT","There was a post in this sub earlier today where a user asked if there were any other lonely guys struggling in dating. Many in the comments were lonely men themselves and expressed despair, which is an understandable emotion since a [man's attractiveness to women is a large part of his social status](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1474704916652144).

So, this post is dedicated to you guys.

[PUAs are telling you to approach 5 women every day](https://www.girlschase.com/article/cold-approach-pickup-right-me), but I need you to repeat this to yourself 5 times a day.

**It's not your fault.**

And it's not just me saying it; **the stats** say so as well. Let's take a look:

[1/3 of young American men are inkwells](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/29/share-americans-not-having-sex-has-reached-record-high/). And that stat was from 4 years ago, so imagine what the amount is after covid, [where 50% of male university students are inkwells](https://www.hepi.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Sex-and-Relationships-Among-Students-Summary-Report.pdf).

Although the solitude may feel all-consuming at times, **you are truly not alone.**

I mean, really, do you truly think a full **50%** of men are ""misogynistic"" and ""toxic inkwells"" with ""bad personalities?""

When I‚Äôve presented this thought experiment, I've often heard people say ""well, I don't see it that way, there can‚Äôt be that many lonely men.""

That's fine, but **the evidence sees it that way.**

Let's look at some other common platitudes that I'm sure you've heard before along with some related stats.

*If you‚Äôre using a mobile, watch out for the .pdf links if you don‚Äôt want to trigger downloads.*

&amp;#x200B;

**Personality:**

""You're only an inkwell because you're misogynistic and have a bad personality bro. Have you tried seeing women as equals bro?""

Inkwells are less likely to [perform violent acts or grape](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40750-023-00220-3) than average men are. This scientific journal article explicitly says that **inkwells are unfairly painted as violent.**

**Attractive men** like college athletes are **more likely** [to commit grape.](https://digitalrepository.trincoll.edu/theses/745/)

Misogynistic men actually have [more sex.](https://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC4842162&amp;blobtype=pdf)

And it turns out that men with ""bad personalities"" actually tend to do better with women overall. Narcissism, machiavellianism, and **psychopathy** in men are [attractive to women.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273809664_The_Dark_Triad_personality_Attractiveness_to_women) And NPD, psychopathy, and sociopathy are **mental disorders.** You cannot fake these.

Never listen to what uninformed normies have to say about your ""personality."" If you're an inkwell, the statistical chances of you actually hurting women are **even lower** than in the general population of men.

&amp;#x200B;

**Neurodivergence:**

""Autism literally doesn't matter bro, just be yourself bro.""

[16% of autistic men are in a relationship. 46% of autistic women are.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5789215/)

[Autistic people are deemed less likable and trustworthy](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep40700#discussion) by IQ-comparable NTs within ten seconds of meeting. And meeting doesn't even matter. NTs also see autists as less likable and trustworthy after seeing autists' **still images.**

[Autistic women are more likely to have been in a relationship than neurotypical men.](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.685256/full) 57% of autistic women have had sex. Meanwhile, only half of autistic men have ever held a girl's hand. **83% of autistic men are permavirgins.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Face:**

""Stop complaining about your face bro, Danny Devito gets chicks bro, the fact that he's a celebrity multimillionaire movie star doesn't affect anything bro.""

[A man's facial attractiveness has been shown to be the strongest predictor of any following romantic interest, whether short-term or long-term.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364661305003207) In fact, women tend to favor certain male faces for short-term relationships and certain other male faces for long-term relationships. As a sample's face becomes more masculine, women want to have sex with the sample more.

&amp;#x200B;

**Race:**

""Most people aren't racist bro, stop blaming your race bro, being Indian doesn't matter bro.""

""The numbers also show that attraction isn't color-blind. To wit:-- Among males, white guys get the most frequent responses (29 percent of the time) and are least likely to respond (40 percent).--[Indian men have the worst luck](https://gwern.net/doc/psychology/okcupid/howyourraceaffectsthemessagesyouget.html), [getting responses only 20 percent of the time](https://web.archive.org/web/20100118050917/http://www.sphere.com/article/revealing-the-mysteries-of-online-dating-even-the-politically-i/19261774).""

[90% of women of all other races would not date an Asian or Indian guy. 40% of Asian women would not date an Asian guy.](https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;u=googlescholar&amp;id=GALE%7CA253444982&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;asid=d06970f5)

[Twice as many Asian women marry interracially](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631383/) when compared to Asian men.

Asian men between the ages of 25-32 are **half as likely as white men** to get into a relationship because ""a racial hierarchy explanation suggests that Asian American men will be less likely than Asian American women to be partnered, as Asian American men face gendered cultural stereotypes barring them from entry into romantic partnerships"" [according to the article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4631383/).

Women have even stronger racial preferences than men do. [The majority of men prefer their own race](http://web.archive.org/web/20100118050917/http://www.sphere.com/article/revealing-the-mysteries-of-online-dating-even-the-politically-i/19261774), but when it comes to women, **it literally becomes ""Just Be White.""**

In fact, this 2021 study shows that [women of all races are more willing to date shorter white men than taller ethnic men](https://youtu.be/vsyPJ_tgLhw?t=58).

At this point, it's no longer a racial preference. It's a **racial dealbreaker.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Height:**

""Girls literally don't care about height bro, you just have to be taller than them bro, like you could be 5'1 and slay the 5'0 chicks bro.""

""[Taller men had more reproductive opportunities](https://www.gertstulp.com/pdf/Stulp%20et%20al%202013_Anim%20Behav_The%20height%20of%20choosiness.pdf) (more marriages, younger second wives) and used them to have more children than shorter men.""

""[The positive effect of height on reproductive performance was not mediated by men‚Äôs social status](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002650100370), i.e., their military rank, or by the measures of academic, athletic, and military talent which helped in gaining high status.""

This is an important point. **Status** and **hard work** are **less relevant** than **height** in **reproduction.**

&amp;#x200B;

A startling and sobering conclusion one can reach from all of this is that a man's **face, race, and height** can be worth, in the aggregate, [millions of dollars to women](http://home.uchicago.edu/~hortacsu/onlinedating.pdf).

A **5'8 average-faced Asian man** would need to earn **$3,696,000** of additional income over the course of a 7 year marriage to be considered as equally desirable as a **5'11.5 attractive-faced white man** to women.

""Just earn millions of dollars bro, anyone can be a millionaire bro.""

The mountains of data are just overwhelming, but when we point them out, we are somehow the bad actors.

&amp;#x200B;

**My story:**

I've decided to save this part for the end. This post is really not about me, but about you.

In short, I'm a 5'7, Asian, and Level 2 autistic guy who's been ostracized from society and my family since the age of 2.

When I was in school, I would be bullied by fellow students for uncontrollable stimming, being Asian, and being fat. Then I would return home to my parents, where I would be beat up for getting a B on a test.

I graduated college as an obese person. I started working out and began losing weight after a mental battle with the rope, **which could have been avoided if I knew the above realities.**

During my ""weight loss journey,"" I was working at a tech company. One day, I was called into a meeting with senior management.

A female coworker had accused me of ""creepy behavior"" in her presence. But security footage revealed that I was sitting near her, but wasn't even looking at her.

Instead, I was **stimming** by flapping my hands and rocking back and forth.

My employer still tried to lay me off for ""making others uncomfortable,"" but I invoked the ADA and threatened legal action. I ended up getting a promotion to a stay-at-home position.

Now, 8 years later, I am lean with a 6 pack and have enough money to have my own house. I did whatever I could.

But when I go to the office once a month, no one talks to me except as strictly necessary. Girls I've never seen before in my life cold-approach me in public and tell me how creepy I am when I'm not even looking at or talking to them. Apparently I'm usually just subconsciously flapping my hands and rocking back and forth.

At this point, this and many other sobering experiences are just my reality. But I know that it's not my fault, just like how **your loneliness is not your fault.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

I want to make this very clear: **I'm not telling you not to try either.** In this world, where [most people under 30 will never be able to afford a house](https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-house-home-real-estate-mortgage-rates-rent-debt-boomers-2022-9), we just have to take what we can get. Self-improvement steps like [going to the gym](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389#:~:text=Exercise%20improves%20mood&amp;text=Physical%20activity%20stimulates%20many%20brain,and%20improve%20your%20self%2Desteem) and [making money](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2208661120) **will make you happier**.

And I don't need a study to tell you that working out is **good for your body**.

***Do what you can to be a better version of yourself***, and ***do it for only yourself.***

But also realize that **it's not your fault if you can't get laid.**

[Mainstream news will say all kinds of bullshit about sexless men](https://www.newsweek.com/newsweek-com-swalling-black-pill-inside-mind-incel-1757788), like how inkwells are supposedly [alt-right snow supremacists](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/books/review-culture-warlords-talia-lavin.html). But the data show once again that the [blackpill community leans left and is comprised of almost 40% POC](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/news/incels-are-not-particularly-right-wing-or-white-but-they-are-extremely-depressed-anxious-and-lonely-according-to-new-research), which squares up very well with the above ""race"" section.

These journalists are **entitled to their own opinions**, but **they are not entitled to their own stats.**

When I say ""**don't be a free agent in life**,"" it's not to sound cool or some shit. **There is a reason for it**, especially in this society where [men are gaslit endlessly about their loneliness](https://medium.com/bitchy/peacocks-love-island-reveals-why-so-many-men-are-single-today-fc7fdfc862b6), the same loneliness that affects [63% of young men, who are single; meanwhile, 66% of young women are in relationships.](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/02/08/for-valentines-day-5-facts-about-single-americans/)

Especially in light of this final empirical finding, I will conclude by saying it once again:

**Don't be a free agent in life. Let the blackpill guide you.**",r/GenZ

I / We're Fucked,"I've never posted on reddit, but for some reason today feels like a day to rant about my inner thoughts. For context, I'm 22 and graduated this year. I applied to dental school with a biology degree and haven't heard ANYTHING from anyone about my application. At this point, I think it's likely that I won't be getting in any time soon and can feel the existential crisis daily. If we're being real, no one cares about a biology degree unless you keep going to school. Getting this useless degree was so unreasonably hard just to have no future and piled debt. ""Go to college and you're guaranteed a job"" said every adult ever to my generation. Now even a Master's degree is becoming pointless with the job market being ass + what seems to be our never ending recession. People keep telling me that I'm still young enough to figure out what I want to do, but never say how or provide guidance. I'm tired of going from job to job just to realize that I no longer have a passion for anything because everything seems out of reach. To make matters worse, the job I am currently at is not good for my health as it is physically taxing with no breaks (which should be illegal???). I've started to develop health issues so I've been trying to get a remote job, but surprise surprise no one wants me. Aside from going to school my entire life and becoming nothing at the end of it, there's also the fact that we are literally witnessing yet another ""once in a lifetime"" moment except this time: it's fucking g\*n0c\\de.

I think we are completely fucked,"I'm currently in my early 20s  and I fear that if I don't achieve a six-figure income relatively soon I may never be able to retire,afford a home and raise a family. The cost of living is rising exponentially, along with inflation. Gen Z faces the grim reality that many of us might never own a home, likely renting for the rest of our lives, and this is if world war III or societal collapse doesn't occur first.

Looking at the example of boomers, around 50% of them don't have enough money to last throughout their retirement, despite being dealt an amazing hand. In 1993, a studio apartment in New York City cost around $600. Today, that same apartment costs around $3,000 to $4,000.

Since then, purchasing power has decreased, and the costs of energy, groceries, and transportation have risen. Despite  salaries increasing (barely) , it doesn't come close to compensating for diminishing purchasing power, inflation, and rising prices. Let's consider a scenario in a normal city where a cheaper apartment is around $1,500 to $1,600, and you're making around $50,000 a year. How are you supposed to afford car payments, health insurance, car insurance, utilities, child care, and save for retirement?

I  predict that $100,000 well eventually become the minimum amount of money that a single adult earner will need to make to have a relatively comfortable "" traditional middle class"" lifestyle.

(Hopefully final vent) why being a 12 year old barley middle schooler in 2019 sucked/sucks and permanently fucked up my memories and experiences,"So yeah I was born in 2007 and is class of 2026 due to getting held back in elementary school and honestly yeah I vent but I'm going more into the backstory here. So 2019 was a fun year and it fucking sucks I was only 12 then, I'm the oldest year that didn't get to be a teen before the biggest event since the second world war. I remember in 2019 was kinda the first year where gen z nostalgia came in and I remember there was a huge Minecraft nostalgia  thing but it obviously wasn't aim at 2007ers, even back then I knew the demographic for this were around 2000-2005 borns and yeah, later there were alot of nostalgia compilations of the 2010s and I remember I only remember a few of the early 2010s ones while everyone in the comments were saying how they remember everything and everyone was attacking 12 year olds/2007ers for getting nostalgic cause they were too young. It sucked still being 12 in 2019 plus we are the oldest target demographic of the coppa shit when it went into effectd. I love 2019 but I also cry because I was too young to really enjoy it to the extent and I wish I was at least a freshman by the end of the 2010s so I can at least have some of my proper teen years in the 2010s but nope the 2010s aren't my decade, I can't even remember 2010 and 2011 that well, I remember feeling old as a 12 year old but also envying older people which is really young and I think gen z getting nostalgic ruin my experiences forever. I'm actually crying while typing this. I FUCKIMG HATE BEING A 2007ER. I always envy 2003-2005ers and I never will be them, I'm after them, they got to experience everything better. If I was born in 2005 or earlier then this feeling wouldn't have happened, I was born too late to get a true gen z experience and as a early 2007er, I have more in common with 2010ers then 2005ers. I'm starting to think we are the first zalaphs tbh but that's not super important rn.  I wish I can change my age but that's not possible and it gonna be 2024 and I'm not even half way through high school. Fuck this shit, this has been In my  head almost 24/7 for months, this feeling will never get better especially since the world is probably gonna far apart even more. Born to late to experience anything truly worthwhile And instead just stuck here. I will never be the age group I wanted to be and instead I am just gonna probably cry about my experiences till I am dying on my death bad probably in my 30s because my lifestyle isn't that healthy.

This is beyond experiences as well, I remember in 2019-2020 I was only starting to put my life together, I was only starting to make friends after getting bullied in elementary school and I was only then starting to have an idea of a career. I didn't talk to anyone in my school for a year and a half and I only have 1 friend irl due to this as I haven't made any friends since before covid and most of them I made before drifted away with times. I thought when I was 12/13 I would feel glad about being 16 and not ""being young"" anymore but I don't think it an age thing but more a birth year thing. I been envying the same birth years for years and this won't change. If I was older covid would of still affected me but I would have more to stand on instead of just beginning to build a foundation of being an actual person.

Idk I'm a nostalgic person but I can't look at the past as that could of been better if I was older back then, the present sucks and the future  will most likely suck more and just existing in General feels awful. Sorry for venting but this has been eating me up and I don't know what to do about it.  Covid created such a big differences between 2003-2005 and 2007-2009 borns imo and I can't relate to them honestly, they know a different world then I do and It hurts to even think people that age cause of their better experiences.",r/GenZ

My boss is gen Z and is always late to work and I have to poop,"Basically the title. I love how she just rolls into work all groggy with the stains from last night's mistakes covering her. I respect the ability to treat our job as important as it deserves to be treated. Bravo.

But I am 31 and am always on time, early even. I don't mind, I'm at the point where it's more enjoyable to be early and relax than squeeze every second out of my morning and potentially arrive late. Again, I get it. I'm an old man. No big deal.

But the thing is, I was raised on the phrase, 'boss makes a dollar, I make a dime, that's why I poop on company time.'

"Is this normal for a bunch of 20 year old Gen Z‚Äôs to be attacking random people on the internet, and posting stuff about them on Facebook?","
Me and my friends (all 20F) lately have been getting cyberbullied by people like Reagan, Star, Vivian, Malcolm, Kaulitz, Tom, and Gisele (all 20) who live in RI. I don't know the bullies personally, but I know of Reagan because Reagan is my mom‚Äôs friend's daughter. My friend Evan (fake name, 20M who is currently dating Reagan and dated a 16F) is friends with the bullies through Tom who works with Evan. These bullies have been calling my friend's offensive names in the group chat for something my friends never did. I had been bullied by these bullies, Gisele body-shamed me. 

Another thing, Kaulitz was calling my friend Selena (fake name, 20F) ‚Äúbaby‚Äù. Reagan stole pictures of my friends. This morning, I informed Evan‚Äôs ex, Melanie (fake name, 20F) that Star stole a picture of Melanie, and Vivian got mad at me because I messaged Evan telling him to have a good day, and Vivian also got mad at me because I informed Melanie that Star was stealing Melanie‚Äôs pictures.

Jobs Today.,"I wanted to talk about our generations job environment. The job market is wildly different and continues to evolve faster than anyone has ever expected. Our generation is mostly seen as the tip of the spear as we progress into the working world. The 1996-2000 Gen Z were either in college or in the workforce during the pandemic, while the 2001-2011 Gen Z were still in school. Both have slight cultural differences with these experiences, but we are still in this new environment together. I am hoping through this post we can all post our strategies and experiences we had together to get the jobs we set out to achieve. 

For myself personally I believe I‚Äôve had more opportunities than most due to my unique circumstances. I have lived in three different states since I was 18 and worked in jobs in both white collar ( desk job ) and blue collar ( tradesman). 

I always followed the burning ships strategy when it comes to employment. I have been a non-union electrician for two years, a appliance technician for two years, finance for a year, and a few small jobs to fill in the gaps. When I was a blue collar worker I was always hired on the spot. Since the millennials and gen Z never went into blue collar a lot of unions and trade companies were eager to hire anyone despite background and experience. I used this environment to switch states whenever rent outpaced my income. In order to move states I would contact a employer either in a union or small business owner that you had the skills to fit their requirements. That employer would write a ‚Äúletter of employment‚Äù to a neighboring apartment saying that you are employed by ‚Äúso and so‚Äù and will be making ‚Äúso and so‚Äù.  Thats how managed to move around so freely. 

Now when I was working as a non-union electrician I was working on a industrial furnace and our company sent out a email stating that all future foreman will be needing a bachelor‚Äôs degree. With the apprenticeship of our school and a bachelors degree that‚Äôs nearly 8 to 9 years of education. So I made a decision to transition into a white collar industry. 

I had some college before the pandemic in Computer Science and I followed a couple Software Engineer YouTubers advice. What they did was created a professional LinkedIn account, intro letter, hired a professional resume maker, and applied to 100 jobs a month. I took that same strategy. Transitioned to night shifts at my job and made sure to apply to at least 4-5 applications a day. I went to a couple interviews during this process and got a few tests from some companies to make sure I was knowledgeable and competent. The current company had me go through 5 different interviews and had me do 3 tests. I got in, but its less than 50k. It‚Äôs comfortable though.

My strategies seem to work. But, what are your experiences that you can share with our generation to give them a real chance in the job market. Is it more difficult to get the better jobs that pay upwards of 65k?",r/GenZ

TW: Controversial opinion. There is actually some truth to the claim that gen Zs are less intelligent,"This is a claim that seems to made fun of and  taken with a nonchalant attitude but all this does not change the reality of the situation. The scientific evidence is quite clear, average genetic intelligence is falling by about 1 IQ point every decade in western societies. So this means that across generations, the formers are much smarter than the latter. yes, boomers are smarter than millennials who are smarter than gen z, who are then smarter than gen alpha. This difference can also be observed by the current decline and breakdown of our modern societies, the falling test and math scores, the decline of school teaching materials especially at higher levels and the bleak future presented based on current events.

It seems that once the millennial generation retires and starts to die out there is going to be a huge shift in american society with every aspect of society getting noticeably worse. much worse than it is currently so if you were hoping for a better future than what we have now, sorry to burst your bubble. And with this fall in living standards and conditions it necessitates a drastic fall in population as predicted by Thomas Malthus in a past age. Is there anything than can be done to salvage this? probably but even if someone were to bring forward a step by step practical plan to avoid this bleak future, i highly doubt it would gain much traction or acceptance.

Why does not having a social media presence scare some people off?,"I have noticed for the past couple of years now, whenever I talk to  a girl for a period of time, I get asked for my socials when I ask for her number.

Fair enough, it is safer and easier for a woman to communicate via social media rather than through her personal number. I get that 100%, I would so the same at this day and age. But, there seems to be a trend among younger people like us, that whenever we find out someone doesn't have a social media presence, it starts to seem weird, suspicious and alarms start going off.

Of course, this goes for both men and women. However, as a guy, I have more experience talking to other guys and notice that usually this isn't that much of a deal for guys. I have a couple of male friends who don't use social media much either, they are very nice people. 

On the other hand, a woman usually sees this as a red flag of sorts. I don't understand it, does not having a social media presence mean something is wrong with you? People have different lifestyles, I don't think it should determine your character and people's impression of you.

I think this is a very interesting psychological phenomenon taking place and figured maybe you guys would have thoughts on the matter.

What do you guys think? Is not having a social media presence an alarming thing, would you feel worried or uneasy when getting close to someone but realizing they don't use social media? Or, would it not matter to you at all? Why do you think it matters in the first place?",r/GenZ

Question about normative masculine friendship from a confused queer millennial.,"Apologies to ops if these questions are not allowed, please remove it if so.

So I was at a party the other day when one of the young people who identifies as a straight cis dude was talking about how sometimes he and his friends (also straight cis dudes) would sometimes massage each other feet when they get together for gaming and such. All of this in a nonsexual way. I have no reason to believe they were bullshitting us. They weren't telling it as a joke or to be shocking. Their tone was totally casual.

Now masculine friendship has gone through phases. In the 18th and 19th century there was something called 'romantic friendship'. It was idealized for someone to form an intense emotional, non sexual, bond with someone of the same gender. This is where ""Best Friend"" comes from. Its how we ended up with the letters between George Washington and General Lafayette showing an affection which, at least in my generation, could only be spoken sexually but which at the time was an idealized nonsexual male friendship.

""by Sunday or Monday, I hope at last to be blessed with a sight of my dear General. There is no rest for me till I go to Mount Vernon. I long for the pleasure to embrace you, my dear General; and the happiness of being once more with you will be so great, that no words can ever express it. Adieu, my dear General; in a few days I shall be at Mount Vernon, and I do already feel delighted with so charming a prospect."" 

Boomers grew up during the Lavender Scare and developed all sorts of hang ups against male emotional intimacy. X'ers and my generation created the Bromance, going back to a healthier and more open masculine friendship.

How far is Gen Z pushing the envelope here? Is what I heard normal? Or something of a trend? What are the boundaries of nonsexual intimacy between gen z men?

To what extent do you think it might be caused by the isolation during COVID, the loneliness epidemic, or something else?

Take care folks.

Fast forward to today, I'm curious: Is there a city(s) right now that's capturing the essence of the 2020's? 

--------


I think the 2020's have made certain aspects of Latino culture more mainstream, like Reggaeton, for example.

... so the only answer I can stir up is Miami, but that doesn't feel right to say. 

Only wealthier individuals can establish themselves there. Not a 20-year old.

Great topic piece on why you should be a Socialist in 2024.,"While if enough GenZ and younger millennials become Socialist and vote Socialist and spread Socialism in conversations and forums, it might not happen this election or for the next two elections before we see a strong socialist candidate, we can at least be the generation of socialism so when our kids are old enough to vote they'd primarily be used to socialism and hopefully have socialists to vote into senate/congress/presidency.


I wish I could say if enough GenZ and younger millennials become socialist we'd have a strong vote in just 10 years, but I don't think that's factually true as long as Baby Boomers/Gen X/Older half of Millenials are alive, those three generations equate to ""socialism bad"", so as long as those three speedbumps of politics and human wellbeing are still around to have power, the younger [GenZ ^(and ^young ^half ^of ^millennials) and newer] working class won't.


But again, at least our kid's kids would hopefully have primarily socialist options to vote for by the time GenZ are the old geezers, but it all starts today with GenZ becoming more and more socialist. We can't have a better future for our grandkids if we today don't start moving towards socialism and away from late-stage capitalism.",r/GenZ

Why does Gen Z dislike millennials and literally regurgitate accusations boomers make about us?,"Gonna get hate but I feel it needs asked.

I've literally heard repeated things like 

Millennials ate tide pods, millennials are lazy, millennials are man/women - childs ie immature adults who don't act like adults.

From gen Z individuals normally things that boomers have blamed us for like tide pods which isn't true since all millennials were adults and it was a very specific pre-teen to teenager thing at the time. Not that Gen Z should get blamed for it either kids have done stupid shit forever from peer pressure and the Christmas story literally made fun of that with kids licking poles social media just makes younger generations more susceptible to peer pressure enmass.

I've heard criticism that millennials have done nothing for the environment or politics and Gen z compared to gen Z and have even seen millennials get blamed for trump... Ignoring that millennials also elected Obama and Trump's election with Hillary has a lot of bullshit going on like how Bernie lost and wasn't even made VP, trump colluded with Russia etc.

Like in general I'm happy with most Gen Z because they appear to be more politically left leaning. But it really feels like some critical thinking skills are just going down the drain like not even gen Z has had large political power and only now as boomers start to die off are any younger gens seeing political power. I don't even know many millennials that even cared that much about gen X to talk shit about them the way some Gen Z do about millennials.

We are the generation that can potentially see the federal (U.S.) and potentially global legalization of cannabis in our lifetime.,"With all the news of cannabis being legalized in more and more US states and countries, it is not impossible that we can see cannabis become less stigmatized, more legally available and more accepted in our lifetime. One exceptional example of a country where cannabis became legal for both medical and recreational is Thailand. A country known especially for its draconian drug laws, where drug trafficking could result in death penalty is becoming the Amsterdam of Asia in terms of cannabis tourism.

In 2020, the United Nations has rescheduled and removed cannabis as a Schedule IV narcotic. This gives more legal opportunity for more countries to legalize cannabis.",r/GenZ

Just now, I went to a party, and the girl I‚Äôve loved since middle school had found someone else. I loved her so much, I thought that even after a decade, she would still love me. But that hope has been shattered. In fact, every hope there was for a good future for me had been shattered since the very beginning.

On September 10th, 2001, I was diagnosed with Autism. My parents were concerned about how it would affect me as I grew older. Little did they know that what would happen the next day would literally set the stage for the fucked up world I would end up living in.

In 2016, I was 18 years old, and the election that year practically changed how I would view politics forever, with the election of Trump. Even then, I still had hope for a better future.

In 2020, my dreams were shattered, and it would be permanent. The pandemic caused me to barricade myself from society, and my social anxiety had worsened. Nowadays, I hardly hang out with my friends anymore, I have a mediocre job as a janitor at a homeless shelter, and I only go out to walk around town, to the mall, or even the city.

And now it seems like 2024, election-wise, will end up being a repeat of 2020. And honestly, I don‚Äôt even care if Trump wins anymore.

If he does end up turning America into a theocratic dictatorship, I really hope that whatever death squad he sends in after us all puts me out of my misery. There is no hope for me left. There never was. I hope that when I die, I end up in an alternate timeline where all the horrible notable events that happened in my lifetime never happened at all.

Another tediously-nuanced classification of Millennial and Gen Z cartoons (and preschool cartoons),"A continuation of sorts from [this post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/generationology/comments/kyadrt/a_tediouslynuanced_classification_of_millennial/)from user u/GuapitoChico, here is another hyper-nuanced classification of Millennial and Gen Z cartoons!

Here's the chart (read below for more information):

https://preview.redd.it/uzs6bssulv8c1.png?width=1169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8d45f0c7fe52fdcee8670bf77299d7007a6cbfb

This is calibrated to the 1997-2012 Pew definition (subjective, obviously) along with Nielsen's 6-11 demographic used for cartoon demographic ratings, with a 7-10 core audience. This age range is the target audience networks use for kids shows - however, age 6 is more of a transition period, as most kids cartoons are TV-Y7 with preschool cartoons being rated TV-Y, for ages 2-6.

|Year of kids TV|Birth years of main audience (6-11)|Peak birth years of main audience (8-9)|% Y/Z|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2002|1991-1996|1993-1994|100% Y|
|2003|1992-1997|1994-1995|83.3% Y, 16.7% Z|
|2004|1993-1998|1995-1996|66.7% Y, 33.3% Z|
|2005|1994-1999|1996-1997|50% Y, 50% Z|
|2006|1995-2000|1997-1998|66.7% Z, 33.3% Y|
|2007|1996-2001|1998-1999|83.3% Z, 16.7% Y|
|2008|1997-2002|1999-2000|100% Z|

But I can't just stop there. For the second half... I added in preschool cartoons! Starting with Little Bear (from 1995) all the way to T.O.T.S (from 2019), i've classified dozens and dozens of preschool shows.

For preschool TV, the age group used by broadcasters is technically 2-5, however most non-educational kids cartoons are TV-Y7 (ages 7+), with TV-Y targeting kids aged 2-6, making 6 more of a ""transitional"" year from preschool cartoons to older kid stuff.

This uses 2-6 as the main audience with 3-5 as the core audience.

For this, I added 2010s preschool cartoons and Gen Alpha into the mix.

|Year of preschool TV|Birth years of audience (2-6)|Peak birth years of main audience (3-5)|% Y/Z or % Z/Alpha|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1998|1992-1996|1993-1995|100% Y|
|1999|1993-1997|1994-1996|80% Y, 20% Z|
|2000|1994-1998|1995-1997|60% Y, 40% Z|
|2001|1995-1999|1996-1998|60% Z, 40% Y|

Generally, if a cartoon has over 80% of it's full audience be birth years of the same generation, the classification will be ""more Y/Z by a landslide"".

If 76%-79% of the audience is of one generation, it'll be labeled ""more Y/Z by a longshot"".

If 71%-75% of the audience is of one generation, it'll be labeled ""significantly more Y/Z"".

If 65%-70% of the audience is of one generation, it'll be labeled ""more Y/Z"".

If 61%-64% of the audience is of one generation, it'll be labeled ""slightly more Y/Z"".

If the cartoon has a 60/40 ratio (or 55/45 ratio) that leans towards the previous/next generation, it'll be labeled as a ""Y/Z cusp, leaning Y/Z"".

If the cartoon has a 50/50 ratio, it'll be labeled as a ""Y/Z cusp (50/50)"".

**NOTES:**

This only focuses on the original run of each cartoon - reruns are not counted in this chart.

The 6-11 and 2-6 demographics are certainly subjective. A 5 year old could easily have watched big kids cartoons and an 11 year old could've felt too old for cartoons in general, but this is more focused on what TV networks are aiming for. 5 year olds and 11 year olds are still in the target demographic for most preschool cartoons and most big kids cartoons, respectively.

The 1997-2012 range for Gen Z is subjective. This should go without saying but I imagine some people will still disagree with this.

If you disagree with the 1997-2012 range, you *can* go into a paint editing tool like GIMP and reclassify all or some of these cartoons to what you think they are.

Here's the base template for this, if you want to make one yourself:

Most things you we're taught about the USSR was probably wrong,"(before anyone feels the need to point out, this is a new account as I have a habit of deleting my accounts on this website when I get bored and then coming back later on a new one)

The entire knowledge about the USSR a lot of people (especially here) have is what they have been taught in school or read in books by western authors, this has many problems.

I'd like to point out is the fact that they tend to be extremely biased a ""great"" example of this is the book 1984, which was meant to be a critique of communism and the USSR, despite the fact that the write hasn't ever been in the USSR and praises Hitler in his book about mein kampf, the CIA spent literal decades and tens of millions of dollars promoting his book to be taught in schools.

Schools both public and private are also have great reason to lie and have a massive bias, western ""democratic"" governments are incredibly corrupt meaning that in most cases the governments side with business owners and rich people, which is why they have every reason to lie about any ideology or country with an ideology that opposes them, same goes for private schools.

A lot of these lies are not really hiding, like the Holdomor genocide despite the fact we can see that the USSR has no record of them intentionally trying to genocide Ukrainians and millions of USSR citizens and non-ukrainians (such as in kazakhstan) died in the same famines that caused massive destruction in the area.

The USSR having no form of electolar democracy despite them holding elections of representatives on many levels and countries absorbed into the USSR having their own local governmental powers, there are even now dicalssified CIA documents that show that US affiliated spies observed a level of collective leadership in the USSR during the 30s.

Another common one is the people in the country constantly starving.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1646771/pdf/amjph00269-0055.pdf

this study for exmple found that in most socialits countries, including the USSR people had a higher caloric intake compared to capitalist countries on a similar level of development

Also much of wikipedia regarding this topic also suffers from the same issues as they often cite the exact sources that I gave a reason for being problematic earlier in this post.

Don't get me wrong I don't believe the USSR was some perfect country by any means, but we can't have a proper discussion about it if the people in the discussion can't properly agree on what can and should be taken as truth,",r/GenZ

I honestly admire y'all.

From what I've seen, Gen Z feels like a more headstrong version of Millennials. Imo one of the few things you can semi-reliably ascribe to a generation is mindset/attitude (and even then it's not absolute).

However, it's true what they say about how every generation goes through similar cycles. I see you all starting to go through the same one with Gen Alpha that we did when you showed up. It's been.. sobering to watch it happen from the outside, so I just wanted to tell you all like I said above - I admire you.

I see a lot of the strengths we have in you, but you're not as burdened by the shock of how awful the systems in place are. You clearly understand the way the world is to a degree, but your reaction to it is very different than ours was. 

I won't keep rambling, I doubt many people will read this but.. try to take it easy on Gen Alpha - they might seem off, but if I can see past our differences you can see past yours.

My girlfriend and I are only 2 years apart but have nostalgia for different eras,"I was born in 1998 and she was born in 2000 (she's actually less than 2 years younger than me technically. 1 year and 10 months)

You would think we would have nostalgia for the same things, but whereas I loved my childhood years and hated my teenage years, she doesn't seem to remember her childhood as well and prefers her teenage years

&amp;#x200B;

So while I have a huge fondness for 2004-2009, and I hate 2013-current, she has a lot of fondness for things from 2010-2016

&amp;#x200B;

My point is, I just think it's funny how not only the year you were born can determine what you're nostalgic for, but also which period of your life you liked more. Technically if someone was born in 2005 and another was born in 2010, the second person could be more nostalgic about the mid 2010s than the first if the first person hated that era of their life

"Earliest decade that my child, likely born between 2034-2040, seems likely to romanticize","I was born in April 5th, 2005. I have about $6,000 saved up from a part time job I started a few months ago and I start working more often when we return for winter break in January. I still live with my parents in our apartment complex but hope to have a child down the line (possibly, I wouldn‚Äôt have more than one) if and when I have more money saved up. 

My parents were born in August 1972 (mom) and January 1975 (dad) if that helps any. 

I have recently started to rewatch clips from that 70s show and dazed and confused. I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôve ever genuinely wanted to live through the 70s though, even though I like much of the music and some of the fashion and have always found it interesting, it feels like a very long time ago (I‚Äôve started to feel the same way about the 80s, even though I loved the stranger things coloring book my job‚Äôs teacher appreciation committee bought me and the stranger things backpack my parents bought me for Christmas.) I‚Äôve been a fan of stranger things since about 2017, and will of course view it with my child at some point. I can‚Äôt see myself having a child past 2040, as I‚Äôve never really wanted to give birth at the age of 35 or older, I‚Äôm really aiming for my very late twenties-thirties (my reasoning for not wanting to give birth at 35 or older is that there are health complications.)

The earliest decade I romanticized personally were the 1950s bc I was a huge fan of back to the future in elementary school, but at this point I don‚Äôt really care for/about them as 1) it was a VERY long time ago 2) I see that this would have been an awful time for me as a young, bisexual black woman. But when I was little, like 7-8, I remember that this was the first decade I was ‚Äúfamiliar‚Äù with up until stranger things caused my 80s obsession in spring 2017 after I watched it (and this lasted until about 2020. Around 2021, I grew tired of the obsession with the 80s and actually found after rewatching the breakfast club that I no longer liked it very much at all.) I regard the 90s as being ‚Äúcooler‚Äù than the 80s at this point. I also grew up watching Rugrats and will likely show that to my child at some point as well

Combating asociality in our generation,"I'm just wondering if anyone has any theories or ideas that they've been ruminating on about how we can connect better as a generation.

I feel like previous generations are much more connected than gen Z and gen Alpha (I'm a elem school teacher and they're struggling too) and while I'm certain COVID played a role in that, I can't really figure out what else is exacerbating the disconnect. Since I don't fully understand why connection is so hard for our generation, I also can't figure out ways that would fix this issue.

I feel like all generations have people that are antisocial, I mean, we are living in an individualistic society, so it's really inevitable, but we have record numbers of self-reported loneliness, depression, anxiety, and the list goes on.

Can we not self reflect on the shortcomings of our generation?,"We have fucked attention spans, we mature at a later age than previous generations, we have all sorts of mental illnesses and our social skills are also fucked. Half of GenZ are ipad kids ffs.

We‚Äôre supposed to be the generation that fixes the broken world boomers left but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to able to at this rate. There are some good things about us as a generation, we strive for equality and fairness, however, that alone isn‚Äôt enough.

We need to shape up as a generation and get stronger. I honestly find it difficult to find people of my generation that are mature and disciplined.

America is a scam,"There's no such thing as an American dream. Never was. ""Working hard"" just gets your more work. It was all a lie.

Majority of citizens work jobs where they are constantly treated like shit from coworkers and management. HR is not your friend they dgaf. Everyone is being exploited. Minimum wage is not enough to afford rent, car expenses, groceries, hygiene products. We barely get time off to do the things we actually love and barely have a social life. All these companies have kept raising prices out of greed. Food doesn't even fill me up like it used to. It feels like I'm eating cardboard. 

We work like slaves, making us constantly drained of energy, barely sleep, the food is all artificial trash filled with chemicals that kill us, they want us braindead and sick, healthcare is trash and poor you if you end up in the ER because that bill can leave you homeless. It's like everyone is one emergency away from losing it all, and the best part nothing can be done about it. 

I was always a top student, always excelled in school, despite my horrible circumstances, spend thousands on a business degree thats worthless now because companies want someone with 10 years of experience. Always worked hard in every job I had and nothing has changed. Congrats to me. I see why people get into crime now. We're fucked one way or another. Good job America, you won. I give up.

Edit: I'm not interested in coming up with a solution right now. I suffer from depression and other mental issues and I'm just fed up at the moment with my current position and finances. My point is Americans shouldn't have to be working multiple jobs (like me) to be able to afford the bare minimum. Call it a breakdown or whatever. I'm tired and I'm not the only one. Its gonna take more than ""postive thinking"" and looking elsewhere to fix a nationwide issue. I feel hopeless at the moment hence why I said I give up.",r/GenZ

I think it‚Äôs abundantly clear that Capitalism needs to end.,"If this last decade has taught me anything, its that the rich and by extension Conservatives (Aka their biggest supporters), cannot be trusted with society‚Äôs future. We are currently living in a society where even if you go to College/Uni and get a degree, you‚Äôd still end up living pay check to pay check because the costs are so high. Why you may ask? Supply and Demand? Maybe a little. But who makes the supply? 

The true culprit is corporations and land lords, jacking up their prices for no other reason than ‚ÄúI WANT ANOTHER YACHT!!!‚Äù and because nobody is telling them ‚ÄúNo, you are not allowed to do that‚Äù. Regardless of who is in charge, nobody seems to have the balls to take the corporations head on, enforce living wages (The kind that would end the Wealth Gap), and bring us the fuck out of this exploitive as hell system we call Capitalism.

 You wanna know why Communism fell? You wanna know why nobody ever tried Communism under a Democratic System? 

Because it would make the Capitalist Countries look bad, exposing how exploitive they are. They don‚Äôt care about us, they never have. It‚Äôs just like they say at where I work, we are all just numbers to them up top. Hell, if you try to unionize these days they‚Äôll just shut the location down forcing you all out of a job without actually firing you for trying to unionize. It‚Äôs their work around.

But I know we aren‚Äôt. I know we deserve better. This oppression, this wealth inequality, it has to come to an end, and it requires us to burn down the system that has screwed us for so long.",r/GenZ

"am i the only one being sick and tired of being told that i'm ""young""?","i'm 23, so I don't know if this would count given that I'm an adult with responsibilities, but sometimes I would have people that are significantly a lot more older than me give me life advice, that would later prove to be absolutely useless, on the emphasis that I'm a ""young person"", yet I don't even feel young anymore

I feel like I have passed my prime long ago (meaning ive never peaked at all), and all I do is either endlessly hunt for a job, play video games to cope with rejection from companies after said hunting, and watch mindless brainrot content on YouTube or Instagram, so I don't know why it seems like most of these people that are significantly older than us are telling me that I'm a young person for doing any of these things and I should ""enjoy my youth"" when there's literally nothing else to enjoy in this world without any cash

I often times envy young people who are in high school like dang they already applying for good colleges, some making thousand of dollars, living their life and meanwhile I‚Äôm in my mid20s lost in some lalala land. I don‚Äôt know what the heck am I doing. A whole year passed by and as I reflect, I haven‚Äôt achieved one single thing. I don‚Äôt wanna compare myself to others but reality check sometimes feels like a slap on my face when I see people my age group figured out life. They‚Äôre working in desired field jobs, finished college, starting up a business or going into a relationship. And I keep asking myself everyday when will my turn come to live life to the max. This whole figuring out life is really overwhelming. I can‚Äôt even remember last time I felt genuinely happy because I‚Äôm always worried stressed anxious overthinking trying to figure out life map. It‚Äôs only leading to inactions causing more anxiety and fear of being behind in life. People retire around 60-70 age, and I feel like I wasted so much time by not working.

I‚Äôm 20 (2003) and I‚Äôm chronically ill so I can‚Äôt work right now and have money. Also, I‚Äôm the youngest. Youngest sibling, youngest grandchild, youngest, youngest, youngest. 

I‚Äôm struggling out here.

In my experience, I feel that we get told all the time that we don't need to have everything figured out right now (about who we are, what we want to do with our lives, etc.), which is so true and that can be very relieving to hear. However, at the same time, in order to be competitive for any sort of college or job or scholarship application or anything else along those lines, without a strong sense of identity and knowing who you are and what you want to do, it can be so hard to stand out. I feel like there is this pressure to do grand things √† la Greta Thunberg, for a more extreme example, but also this continuous babying and being told that, no, we don't have to have everything figured out, nor do I think we have the tools to considering all of the noise and content we take in on a daily basis.

Is it weird that i've been disappointed with christmas?,"For the last few years, I (17F) have been a tad disappointed at christmas and my family picks up on it. 

part of it is the gifts, I tell my family i'm really grateful for everything they give me and just THEM in general. I always thank people when they give me stuff. That being said these past few years i haven't gotten a lot that I actually like. i'm always told ""you're so hard to buy for now that you're older!"" but I feel like im not? I'm an absolute open book. I'm a fantasy nerd and my aesthetic is really obvious. and I even make super specific wishlists with links to specific items and try to include a decent range of prices. 

But then, for example, I wanted this one weighted blanket that I put on my wishlist. And my mom ended up buying me *a* weighted blanket, which i'm pretty sure was MORE expensive, but looked absolutely nothing like the one I suggested. If i'm being honest, I really didn't like the design, and I have no idea why she chose it because it doesn't go with my room or any of the kind of styles I like. 

I'm not trying to be ungrateful. I am so thankful that I even get to have a christmas and presents. I just don't understand why it's supposedly so hard to buy gifts for me that I actually like. It's like my family has no idea what I like despite me being so obvious about it. And I have no problem getting/making them gifts that they love despite the fact that it is so hard to squeeze any suggestions out of them. 

((By the way, it's not JUST the presents i'm disappointed with. I feel like there's just not the same effort there was when I was younger. I also used to live up north and there'd be snow and stuff and now I live in florida and it's so depressing. Nothing feels christmassy. It's so hard to get in the spirit down here.",r/GenZ

How do we feel about marriage?,"I, male, for one am not religious and marriage for me is always gonna be connected to religion. So i feel very uncomfortable imagining myself getting married.

What do you guys think of arranged marriages?,"I figured this would be an interesting question since dating is so difficult nowadays.

The West has a certain view of arranged marriages and I totally understand why.  But hear me out.

I come from a country where arranged marriages are normal and many of my own cousins and older friends have gone this route. I have asked them about their marriages and they seem happy. They get matched with people similar to them and also on equal footing, so no one has power over the other.

For example, one my cousins back home  is a successful lawyer and she married a dentist who's family was looking for a wife for him.

One of my friends is an accountant, and he married someone who is on track to become a professor at a university.

I am **not** talking about the illegal, unethical and  universally shunned kind, those are what manage to get headlines in the news.

I am talking about two families with  a son/daughter seeking to get married. They discuss their family's history, professional background, education, attitudes, values and so on so forth. Then the two in question get to know each other better over a period of time and decide whether they want to proceed with an engagement or not.

I figured that since both parties have mutual consent, clear intentions and expectations , it  honestly seems safer, time-saving and less troublesome  for both men and women.

I am a bit biased because of where I come from, and that I am tired of the dating game at the moment. I thought I could find someone on my own while I am a university student but that is not working out at all.

can we stop bashing on gen alpha,"I go on literally any site and see something about ""I'm worried for gen alpha"" or something. Can we honestly just s h u t u p. WE ARE THE ONES BUYING DRUGS AND I AM PRETTY SURE THAT'S WORSE THAN SAYING ""gyatt"" or whatever slang. Also... If you were born in 2007+ You likely carry some attributes of a gen alpha. (Gen zalpha like zillenials) unrelated but just wanted to say. I hear people in 9th or 10th and below use gen alpha slang all the time. gen alpha is tame compared to us buying dangerous drugs that affect us badly. People are being so overdramatic about gen alpha saying they are cringe meanwhile some of us are pushing the idea of 48 genders and I am sure gen z's youtube comments were just as bad if not worse than gen alpha. We say they are so cringe when they aren't really. Our slang is cringe to imo. Look it up... If anything I'm worried more than gen z than gen alpha cause we are raising gen beta soon and there is going to be probably a lot worse things going on. We are the first generation where teen pregnancy is a problem. People say gen alpha is always on their devices. WERENT WE TOO... It's so ridiculous. The hypocrisy. Can we learn to not be hard on PEOPLE YOUNGER THAN THE AGE OF LIKE 11? Nobody is smart then. Everyone acts dumb and rude until the age of maybe 20.

Don't turn your life into a self-fulling prophecy-- just because you're statistically less likely to obtain success doesn't mean you should stop trying,"There's this attitude I've seen in Gen Z circles where people basically stop trying with their lives because they're statistically less likely to obtain the same standard of living that their parents did. I've seen it when talking about climate change, the housing crisis, the current economy, with certain marginalized groups, etc. and I understand that it's incredibly demotivating to know that you can work your ass off and still never succeed. But I also understand that the chances of someone obtaining success dwindles down drastically as soon as they stop putting in effort.

I'll use housing as an example. Statistics say that most individuals in Gen Z have a *small* chance of homeownership before age 30. If you let that get to your head and stop saving for a house though, then that number will plummet to a 0% chance of homeownership before 30.

I kinda get the appeal, especially as someone on the more social reject end of the stick.

"What's the difference between 2008-09 and 2010, and why do people on here think?","The only reasons i've seen on here are:

* Born after the iPad and in the 2010s

Completely meaningless and arbitrary. Someone born in 2009 was 1 when the iPad came out, and they'd certainly have no memory of 2010-2011.

* First year that's been labeled as Alpha

This is also meaningless and arbitrary. 1977 used to be put as the start of Millennial, now most people don't even consider 1977 cusp. 1993 has also been used as a Gen Z start in Canada, and most agree they're not Zillennial.

* First elementary schoolers during COVID

No, 2009 babies were the oldest in elementary school during COVID. They were still in 5th grade when COVID hit, and would spend most of their K-12 in a post-COVID world, which everyone seems to overlook so they can gatekeep 2010.

Most schools (like, 90%) do not consider 5th grade as middle school, and even if it is middle school, it doesn't take away the fact that someone born in 2009 were the first to spend the majority of K-12 education after COVID. Many 2009 babies were also still 10 for half of 2020, and late 2009 babies were 10 for almost the entire year. It doesn't matter if someone born in 2009 was ""barely in elementary school"" before COVID. Because someone born in 2002 was also ""barely in high school"" during COVID, but they still graduated afterwards.

Every single reason i've seen for starting Alpha or Zalpha in 2010 is completely arbitrary and not based on anything whatsoever. People born in 2009 do have some lasts (most of K-12 under Trump/Obama, in school before gay marriage became legal), but so does 2010 (in school before the Paris bombings and before the political climate of today took hold, most of K-12 before the Ukraine war and before Roe V Wade got overturned)

I've never seen *any* real legitimate, good reason for Zalpha/Alpha to start in 2010. It feels entirely arbitrary.

If we based it around COVID, the real Zalpha cusp would be 2009-2014, as both 2009 and 2014 were in K-5 before it hit, but will spend most of their K-12 education in a post-COVID world. 2009-2011 would lean Z (most of K-5 before COVID) and 2012-2014 would lean Alpha (most of K-5 after COVID).

Or you could just make 2009-2012 Late Z and have Zalpha go from 2011-2014 if you used K-6 with COVID, or if you are classifying it by late 2010s/early 2020s or ""COVID"" hybrid kids.",r/GenZ

I can't stress this enough...talk to your parents about their old age. Americans are dying broke and the burden is falling on their kids.,"[https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2024/01/04/americans-dying-broke](https://www.wbur.org/hereandnow/2024/01/04/americans-dying-broke)

&amp;#x200B;

**No one is preparing you for this.** Your parents have probably buried their head in the sand when it comes to their aging. If you talk to people about retirement, their usually laugh and say they're *""going to die at their desk""*. ***They won't.*** They'll break a hip. Have a heart attack, etc and need many many years of care before they die.The family usually dumps the responsibility on one person. Often the oldest girl. Or if you're in a dink couple, they all just assume you can do it. It's incredibly stressful and unfair. Try and make sure your parents are not in this situation and don't burden you with more than you could possibly handle.

**Couple of tips:**

\-So many old people are next level hoarders. Tell them tough shit and clean out the house, now. They need to be able to get around their house with a walker or a wheelchair. EMTs need to be able to get a stretcher into the house. The house needs to be clean enough that a care giver might consider taking a job there. Caregivers are hard to get. It also needs to be clean enough that you can stay and help if need be. By the time they've broken a hip and need help, it's too late. Its exhausting to try and clean a house out and manage someone's health.

\-Try to encourage your parents to buy a one level house if it's an option and keep it maintained.

\-The goal is to have a home that they can stay in for as long as possible. Long term care apartments start at around 6k. Some will seem like less, but those places just charge for every extra little thing, so ends up same as the 6k. More likely they'll end up spending around 10k a month until they can no longer get up and down on their own. Once they can no longer get out of bed themselves, it skilled nursing at 10-20k a month. Very few people can afford that.

\-Medicaid facilities are appalling. One 18$ an hour aid caring for 40 patients. People sit in shit filled diapers for hours, end up getting sepsis, bed sores and uti's. For that appalling level of care, there is a a 5 year look back period on assets. Many states won't force you to sell the home, but after the patient dies, require you to pay back if there was a house that could be sold.

\-Get a financial and health power of attorney. Get a will and avoid probate. Probate is expensive and can be a bit corrupt. Tell your parents not to be cheap about estate planning. Talk to an elder care attorney now about how to structure this.

Edit...wasn't clear here. You need a trust to avoid probate. Or a will that pours over to a trust. In any case...talk to someone about it to see what applies to your state. Probate in places like California is insanely expensive. 

\-Long term care policies are about non-existent now, so don't plan on buying one to cover things. If your parent tells you they have a long term care policy and are ""ok"", check on it. They probably aren't covered like they think they are. Sometimes those policies cover very little and didn't adjust for inflation. (My relative had one that covered $1500 a month. About nothing. Paid over 60k into it for it to cover 50k after 6 months. 4 years max).

&amp;#x200B;

I can't tell you how often I read that the entire burden of caring for an aging family member gets dumped on one sibling. If that is unfortunately going to be you, be prepared to resent the fuck out of your siblings. They'll disappear. They'll have excuses. A lot of caregivers are depressed, suicidal, desperate and have absolutely no where to turn for help. They don't get paid. They have to quit their jobs. They burn through their savings. They work 24/7. No one thanks them. No one offers to give them a break. No one gives a shit. They disappear from existence in caring for their elderly relative. Their lives stop. They can't date, meet people, see friends. Even the people they are caring for are rarely thankful for their help. It's wild.

Just warning you...it's a situation I'm seeing with more and more people. Don't let your parents off the hook and avoid planning for the future. The problem doesn't go away. It just gets dumped on you! And for those of you that think you'll just walk away and your parent will be on their own, it seems not to work that way a lot of the time. Even with shitty parents who never did anything for their kids.

Two of my friends have had to move back to their native countries because they simply can't afford to be here anymore. It's crazy.

Is Gambling a dying industry to Millennials? Do you go or have interest in going?,"I work as a table games dealer and although I get some clientele in our age bracket and younger, it's (obviously) a majority of older generation with a lot or disposable income.

With so many of us struggling financially, I couldn't imagine even trying to risk any money I have on gambling (and since I'm around it daily, I see the damage it can do to anyone - luck plays more into winning than people think, unfortunately).

If you don't already have a Roth IRA what are you waiting for?,"I didn't open a Roth IRA until I was in my 30's because nobody ever explained to me how important it was. I missed out on 10+ years of tax free growth and I really only learned about it from reading shit on Reddit. You can open a Roth IRA with whatever amount of money you feel comfortable with, $100, $500, $1000, whatever you want. You can even automate small weekly, bi weekly or monthly contributions like $25 per paycheck. There *is* an annual maximum that you can contribute (7k in 2024) but most of us are too broke to worry about that.

Anyway, a Roth IRA doesn't cost you anything to open or maintain, the money grows tax free and anything you contribute is better than nothing. I'm just grabbing this example from Google but if you contribute 5k per year to a Roth IRA and earn an average annual return of 10%, your account balance could be worth around 250k in 20 years. Yes, 5k is a lot and 10% return might not happen but cut those numbers in half and its still a decent amount of dough. Sorry I'm not smart enough to explain this better or in more detail but hopefully this post at least puts it on your radar, if it wasn't already.

EDIT: a few comments bring up some valid points that i thought were worth adding here. Yes, if you‚Äôre fortunate enough to have a 401k, especially with any type of employer match, you would likely want to prioritize contributions to your 401k over an IRA.

And regarding traditional IRA vs Roth IRA there are some pros and cons based on your expected tax bracket in retirement years but considering most other retirement vehicles will be taxed and not knowing how things can change over the next 20-30 years it‚Äôs nice to have something tax free in my opinion.",r/Millennials

"It seemed like society was more excited about science fiction, space travel, aliens, and the future back in the 1990s and I wish that sort of excitement and optimism would make a comeback some time in my lifetime","I was just a small child during the very end of the 90s who liked to watch ""Rugrats"" and play ""Gran Turismo 2"" on their PSOne.

Looking back through rose colored glasses it seemed like there was more excitement for space, sci fi, the future, and the possibility of alien life existing back in the 90s.

There were multiple ""Star Trek"" shows as well as ""Babylon 5"", and ""Farscape"" along with movies like ""Contact"", ""Independence Day"", ""The Fifth Element"", and ""Men in Black"".

In the 2000s military and techno thriller type stuff became popular and in the 2010s it was fantasy, zombies, and superheroes.

Not much of a zombie type guy but I did really enjoy Marvel and some of the DC stuff as well as ""Game of Thrones"" but I am losing interest in the MCU and I hope that science fiction becomes the big thing of the 2020s.

I want to see Andy Weir's ""Project Hail Mary"" and Arthur C. Clarke's ""Rendezvous with Rama"" become adapted to the big screen. I want to see the world of Vernor Vinge's ""A Fire Upon the Deep"", a series that along with Babylon 5 would influence the ""Mass Effect"" video games a decade later as well as Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Mars Trilogy"" and Turtledove's ""Worldwar"" series, a series about aliens invading during WW2 be adapted into TV shows.

A Mass Effect TV show if done right would be also be nice.

""For All Mankind"" is great but a great show with far future technology and aliens would be also be awesome.

Unearthed a journal entry (2010) re movies that shaped me in my 20s (from Central Station to True Grit),"Hey Redditors, (37M) here. I come from Southeast Asia, so my access to films and movies, especially the non-blockbuster variety, has been limited compared to those who grew up in big and/or coastal cities in the US and elsewhere. Anyway, I moved to a new apartment this week and upon going through my stuff (to decide which one to keep or throw) I stumbled upon a list from around 2010 of movies that left a mark during my years as an adult then --- I was approaching the final part of my 20s at this time. The list went: 

Central Do Brasil,

AI: Artificial Intelligence,

 Road to Perdition, and

True Grit (Remake).

I made a short note in that 2010 journal entry that hey, they are all related! They revolve around a reticent protagonist with a sudden mission, a lost child seeking a home, and the transformative journey that follows ---

1. Central Do Brasil (1998):  Dora, a former schoolteacher, reluctantly helps a young boy reunite with his father in Brazil's vast landscapes.

2. AI: Artificial Intelligence (2001): David, a highly advanced robotic child, embarks on a quest to become ""real"" and find a place in a world that questions his humanity.

3. Road to Perdition (2002): Hitman Michael Sullivan seeks redemption while protecting his son from the dangers of the criminal underworld during the Great Depression.

4. True Grit (2010): Mattie Ross hires U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn to help her track down her father's killer, navigating a dangerous journey in the Wild West.

I actually don't remember much about these movies anymore, maybe because so many things have happened in the 14 or so years since I made that list, including the pandemic.  (I even vaguely remember anything anymore from 2017-2019!)

But I like it that the films I listed actually share common threads: a reserved lead thrust into a mission, a lost child yearning for a home, and the ensuing odyssey that reshapes characters.

Redditors, any unifying themes I missed? Psychoanalysts, what does this say about my personality or mindset (if any)? And, were these movies as cool as I remember? Looking forward to your insights!",r/Millennials

Even if you put 20% down you still pay double the cost of the house at  881,142.36.

Why does no one talk about this? I wanted to buy a house but when I learned this I'm so turned off by the idea of spending 400k+ in interest to some fucking bank while also paying insurance for them incase i can't make payments as if they don't get the house if I default already.

How do you overcome extreme work-related burnout? I feel like I‚Äôll never be my old self again,"Back in 2022 I took on a demanding role where the expectations in terms of responsibility / my performance were not entirely clear and there was little to no guidance or training. Up to that point, my role had already been demanding, but in the new position the volume of work, increased responsibility, and the pressure to perform led me to experience very physical signs of stress. I was getting migraines and vomiting on a regular basis, my anxiety was so high that I would start crying uncontrollably any time of day (normally I‚Äôd find that unprofessional, but I couldn‚Äôt hold back even if I tried) and, even though I am a very social person, social interaction outside of work became incredibly overwhelming ‚Äî it felt like everyone needed something from me and I just wanted to shut the world out. 

I left the company after a year of working in that role and took a break for 3 months before looking for a new job (I feel lucky that I was in a position do do that). However, even a little over a year after that situation was over, I still feel like my mental health is so fragile. I feel like I am unable to work as hard as I once did, or even to care about work enough to put myself in a position where I can work late hours or throw myself into my career again. I feel detached and like I am constantly seeking excuses to not work hard or excuses to explain to myself why I‚Äôm not doing my very best at work. Overall, I am unmotivated and honestly pretty heartbroken over the fact that I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever be the person that I was before‚Ä¶ unafraid to take on challenges, hungry, and driven to grow in my career. I‚Äôm in my early 30s and still have goals to accomplish. I feel like it‚Äôs too early to feel this way.

How do we feel about having that perfectly manicured lawn that our dads stressed over?,"This is along the same vein as a post a few days ago about millennials not really caring about having an immaculately-kept home. 

For the few of us that actually own homes, do we have time or interest in taking care of our lawns? Besides what our HOA‚Äôs mandate? 
And to clarify, I‚Äôm not talking about personal backyard gardens, I totally get having a few tomato and pepper plants at your disposal. I‚Äôm talking about the actual grass. 

When I was younger, my dad REALLY cared about his lawn. Mowing religiously, fertilizing, weeding, watering, etc. When my mom would tell me to go out and help him, he would just bark that he had it handled and didn‚Äôt need help. It was his escape. After a day of mowing, bagging, weed whacking, he‚Äôd sit in a chair on the back porch with a beer and literally watch the grass grow back admiring his work.

I‚Äôm all for a job well done, but I have zero interest in maintaining a yard to that level. I mow it enough to keep the HOA off my back and to make it accessible for my kids to run around. I don‚Äôt weed, I don‚Äôt fertilize. I run a mover over it every few weeks. And most of my millennial friends, this seems to be the same. We‚Äôd rather be spending our weekends doing other things.

Most adults owned a pager but around the late 90s, teenagers also had one and some of them even brought it to school (at least in my area).

So many Millennials with followings on social media become insufferable once they have their 1st kid,"I feel like I've seen dozens of people fall victim to this over the past few years, where they develop a large following for one reason or another when they are young, and their posts are funny and interesting, but as soon as that first kid happens they flood your feed with cringe post after post that solely revolves around their status as a new dad (""Send me your dad jokes!!!"") or all of their content just becomes about the baby, and they never seem to realize why their following, reacts and view count falls off a cliff, as their posts just become more and more insufferable and lame, and their entire personality disappears and changes to revolve around exploiting their kids for likes from strangers. This is one of the only instances where I wish my generation could be more like the Boomers, who didn't seem to suffer those same type of personality shifts.

Edit:

I knew this would be a polarizing  topic and that a lot of people wouldn't like what I have to say  (particularly since I added a boomer compliment) or interpret what I was  trying to get out poorly. And that some would agree and understand what  I was getting at. I would just like to say though that I absolutely  love kids. I love going to friends houses and seeing them, I do have  some really close bonds with some special little people. This wasn't  meant to be a ""child hater"" post. And by no means was this meant to be a  post about shitting on Facebook moms with 300 friends flooding the  feeds of people they went to high school with. My closest friends are  all women and I love when they have meaningful posts about their kids,  posts about actual achievements and stuff of that nature. I was more so  going after the people who built up 1000's of followers based on a  certain type of content (whether it be shitposting, controversial humor,  tutorials, sports or whatever) but then as soon as they have that 1st  kid they become overly obsessed and jam it down their followers throats,  the throats of 1000's of strangers, when they just 100% shift their  content output to mundane needless posts about their kid/dad life with  sappy captions....Youtubers who had channels for years, that suddenly try to needlessly incorporate their 3 year old with ADHD into the videos and talk over their endless babbling while they review some tech product..... I know a lot of young men and women who absolutely  refuse to put their children's lives on the internet and parenthood  didn't effect who they were. My best friend is 34 with three kids and  she is the funniest person on the planet and the same exact person I met  at 17. I just sometimes feel that parenthood changes people for the  worst and makes them more insufferable than they realize they are being.

All  in all it's not a HUGE deal to me, it's not like I toss and turn about  this at night. Just thought I'd post a 'rant' and see if it sparked some  sort of debate. Maybe to some I come off as 'miserable', so be it, I knew people would have all kinds of reactions.",r/Millennials

Do you feel like kids growing up in the 2020s are missing out on a lot of the magic we experienced in our childhoods?,"Or is this just nostalgia talking? 

Irrespective of covid, when I think of my younger cousin and other pre and early teens these days it seems that they're missing out on a lot of what made childhood feel magical back in the late 90's through early 2010s. 

I'm talking about the many toy fads that took us all by storm, from digimon to beyblades to scannerz to tech decks to sea monkeys. 

Killer cartoons that still hold up like spongebob and fairly odd parents. 

Anime that everyone could get behind like pokemon, one piece and dragon ball z, 

The golden age of pixar and disney, and a lot of iconic comedy. Watching movies was a bigger deal since you had to acquire the physical media, and therefore we weren't so apathetic about it as we are now that streaming services are the norm. Browsing Blockbuster was incredibly exciting, even if there was a good chance the disc you hired was so scratched it would pause after a few minutes. 

Book series like goosebumps and deltora quest and Eragon were like gateways to another world, and most kids from school were reading. No young kids I've asked today read anything besides what's required for school. 

Ipods were being released and the ability to walk around listening to a library of music on a discreet device was awesome. Also finding it was an adventure since with limewire you never knew if you were downloading  green day say or Russian snuff porn. Taking to the high sea on the pirate bay was also a lot of fun. 

Fashion trends we now laugh at like frosted tips, popped collars, heely shoes etc were fun if nothing else.  

The food was a whole lot less healthy but a whole lot tastier, and school lunches were diabetes inducing as if parents had no concept of the health detriments of excess sugar...but it made things bloody fun 

Video games were fresh and exciting and evolving rapidly with every year - it wasn't saturated with micro transactions and marred by incomplete game releases. Spryo, Zelda, Halo, World of warcraft, Sims, Grant theft Auto... the release of groundbreaking game consoles and handheld devices which blew our minds.  

Going on the internet was a big deal, and the internet itself was like the wild west. Newgrounds, Miniclip, early Youtube. 

Hunting for porn was a treacherous but invigorating and mission, and even softcore porn magazines like ZOO, and the adult section of blockbuster were exciting. The relative difficulty of finding erotic stuff made it more rewarding. 

Kids were still riding bikes in neighbourhood groups (or gangs if you asked them) with some free rein. I was out in my friends fathers workshop making ninja stars out of tin sheets and making our own nunchucks. Climbing trees, jumping off bridges into waterways. 

It seems these days that not only are kids kept on shorter leashes (parents tracking their movements with life 365!?) but they have less desire to even do these things. When my cousin has a day off now he just scrolls tik tok or watches netflix on his ipad. 

Going to the mall was the thing to do, and most malls seemed to cater for this, with fountains and botanical gardens in the concourses, arcades, donut shops.

McDonalds and Burger King etc used to host birthday parties (a ridiculous concept but it was still fun) - nowadays they've gone for a sterile industrial look and many have removed their playgrounds. 

Rollerskating rinks, ice skating, laser tag etc still exists but doesn't seem as popular with the young ones. 

Kids weren't exposed to as much depressing world news or expected to partake (online) in global liberation movements and causes, which whilst not a bad development, means that kids these days have less time to live in blissful ignorance and simply be kids. Although some of the shock gore sites definitely scarred me. 

Of course there are still trends that have come and gone in the last decade - Pokemon GO being the one that jumps out the most, but also fortnite, overwatch, tik tok challenges and physical toys like hoverboards, and it could be argued that snapchat and other social media are trends in themselves, but they don't seem to bring the same joy and magic. Activities like axe throwing and escape rooms have trended but they're geared toward an older crowd. 

I realize every generation says this of themselves and I'm basing this off my cousin, his friends and conversations I've had about friends kids, but I truly do feel that childhood these days isn't quite as magical as it was in our gen and early Gen Z's. Their lives are arguably physically healthier and more comfortable but not as fun. Obviously it wasn't all rainbows for many of us, I had a violent relationship with my abusive father, and the world was still marred by conflict and terrorism but overall it was an awesome time to be a child.  

It seems like the landscape shifted around 2012 - 14  when smartphones, social media and streaming services became ubiquitous, and by 2015 it seems that even trends like app store games were more or less over. 

Everything these days seems conspicuously monetized, packed with advertising, requires subscription and all your details, and is whitewashed so as not to potentially offend anyone. 

Maybe I'm just an old man reminiscing.

"I have completely turned my life around since COVID/2020 - from a negative, bitter and cynical person to someone who can genuinely see a positive way forward","First, some background on me - 

Born in '86, first 10 years in Gulfport, FL - the rest in St. Petersburg, FL

Grew up in a blue collar family - dad was a cable repair guy and mom worked in the call center. We never went hungry but we definitely didn't have a lot of 'extra'. 

One older sister by 2 years, recipient of an undiagnosed mental disorder, finally diagnosed in her late 20s.

Parents split up when I was 10

Middle and high school were nuts - standout memories: Y2K panics, the Columbine shooting, Princess Diana's untimely death and 9/11. In middle school, I once counted 10 bomb threats that forced evacuation \_before\_ the winter break. Also in middle school there was a thwarted attempt to take a portable hostage (there were plans, masks, knives and everything), as well as at least two gun related deaths off campus that I can remember, one of which was due to a game of straight up Russian Roulette. 

My dad let me know pretty early that he couldn't afford to send me to college so if I wanted to go, I should get scholarships. Thanks to Bright Futures Scholarship program in Florida, I was able to get 75% of my undergrad education covered, and put the remaining 25% on credit. 

I graduated in 2009 with a Political Science degree during the Great Recession and due to very limited options, ended up (reluctantly) following my family's footsteps and got a job at the cable call center. From there, I was able to post internally and move into back-office support roles. My company invested in building my skills and I became a process and change management expert. In 2012, I was lucky to have enough money to become a first time home buyer before the markets had started to recover from the 2008 crisis. I'm still living in that house. 

My cable company got acquired in 2016 and I chose to leave, eventually landing in the Project Management role I am in today for a global consulting and outsourcing company. I make a little over $100k, which I always thought would be the number I needed to hit to have 'made it'. I'd say... ""by the time I'm 35, I'm going to be making $100k!"" And then all my troubles would be gone (insert lol). 

Well, we all know that kind of salary isn't what it was worth when we were all kids. Still, it definitely takes care of all my needs and thanks to the good timing on buying my house, I am overall in a pretty secure place. 

And yet, leading up to 2020, I still found that I was a grumpy, cynical and combative person - disillusioned by a lot of the things that come up in this sub regularly. My instinct was always to isolate - to minimize my obligations to the world and vice-versa. I was overweight, putting my entire identity into my job and leaned into vices like nicotine and alcohol to take the edge off my negative feelings. 

Then COVID happened. And honestly not a lot about my life changed. Since I was already pretty isolated, it was a breeze for me to stay home, binge watch TV and have my groceries delivered. But something about the slow down during that time caused me to look around with a fresh eye. I realized  how neglected my house was - like I place I just stayed overnight usually, and didn't actually live in. The kitchen was disorganized and the back yard a combination of a trip hazard and sand lot. Being in the neighborhood more, I realized I only knew a couple of my neighbors after living 8 years in the same place. 

So I decided to put some time and effort into fixing up my space - especially since I was spending 24/7 within the confines of my corner lot. After the back yard got a face-lift, I spent more time outside and discovered that Florida does have seasons - even if they are not as extreme as they are further North. Spring comes with a certain kind of birdsong and Fall comes with an entirely different atmosphere of fading light. 

I stopped watching the news so much, until eventually I stopped watching all together. I started reading more about topics that really interested me like neuroscience and psychology. With these initial changes, I had created some space for myself that wasn't as negative. This created a kind of incubation period for me to consider an entirely new way of living. 

A way of living that centered around what I personally could control, which was myself. I began to realize that all my anger and frustration about things I couldn't control was a complete and utter waste of time, not to mention a health hazard. I was the cause of most of my own problems, which instead of being scary felt like an amazing revelation... because if I was the cause, then I was also the solution. 

So... in the 3 years since COVID hit the US, I systematically changed my organically derived preference for negativity into a preference for positivity, which has absolutely changed my life for the better. The number of friends in my life has easily tripled, my connection with my family has never been deeper, I donated part of my corner lot property to something I call the Community Happiness Project which promotes increasing thoughts and feelings of positivity through things like Happiness Rocks, affirmation scrolls, neighborhood notebooks where we write notes to one another, and much, much more.

My process background definitely helped, and I believe that anyone can do what I have done if they commit to the process. I feel so strongly about it that I wrote a book called, ""The Blueprint to Happy"" that will be published on June 6th, 2024. This is a guide that helps set the conditions for a happy life - whatever that looks like for readers. I don't know what it looks like for everyone, but I am confident that I know the process to help create the conditions for it to happen. 

Like most folks, I am feeling the financial squeeze of inflation, unexpected medical bills and supporting my aforementioned sister financially. So I'm running a Kickstarter for the Blueprint this month, offering pre-orders on the book to help pay for the editing, design and marketing costs to make my June 6th publication date. I can share the campaign upon request. 

Finally, I want to share why all of this gives me hope that there is a positive way forward. As a Millennial, I feel like all of us have witnessed the \_potential\_ for a different, brighter future. The Dawn of the Internet, Al Gore almost being president, unity like no other post 9/11, Social Justice in the wake of George Floyd, and the veil being lifted of the way things 'have to be' thanks to COVID - less pollution, more creativity, free vaccines, testing and medical care, financial support for those who need it, etc. 

I do believe the ingredients, the desire and the technology are all present to create a world that we are all excited to live in. Just not at the scale we need. Because it starts with the individual. If everyone is hunkered down, isolated in their little box and constantly fixating on the many things that are infuriating about our current reality, we might as well be stuck in the quicksand we were all led to believe would be a major danger in everyday life. If, however, 51% of people (possibly less, some social scientists think tipping points are possible between the 10-40% adoption range) establish a preference for positivity which allows them to think clearer, become better problem solvers, broaden and deepen their relationships and live healthier, then we have the critical missing component required of positive change. That component is positive engagement \_at scale\_. 

To put it in simpler terms... every individual is part of a larger group - a family -&gt; community -&gt; nation -&gt; world, and how that individual chooses to live their lives will have a material difference on the larger group. So if we got enough people to make a positive change in their lives, the knock on effects are incredible. 

Since COVID, I have noticed I am not the only one on this path. Many folks have been increasing their awareness on the power of their thoughts and focusing on what is within the scope of their control. I am pleased to be one voice of many, and I am hoping that my voice resonates enough with people to help them accomplish what I have done. A lot of folks in this sub pose the question of, ""Yeah things are BAD but why not DO something about it?"" - this is my 'do something'. This could also be your 'do something'. Every little bit counts. Thanks for reading! ",r/Millennials

Millennials are broke but resourceful. A lot of what we've learned is out of necessity and we're better for it.,"Maybe it's just me and my circle of trust but we've all taken our time to learn productive skills and have hobbies that come in handy quite often. 

We all like the outdoors and do a lot of fishing, hunting for mushrooms, and most of my male friends hunt for game. 

We garden and have a love for plants and knowledge about their uses. 

We're not afraid to at least try and fix our homes, vehicles, appliances, etc. 

We enjoy cooking from scratch and sharing meals as a group. Preserving food and avoiding the SAD. 

We discuss how we will handle the next recession and/or emergencies if/when they arise as a group.

Where exactly do you think this outrageous tipping culture came from?,"We've all seen the posts about how tipping in the US has gotten out of hand recently. People feel pressured to tip for services they haven't normally had to tip for and even restaurants are charging percentage service fees and flat rate gratuities more than ever.

We know when it started, during the pandemic roughly. My question is where this all started. Like how did we get the idea of ""hey let me charge a tip for that (when no one really has before)"" or ""if you don't tip me 20% I'm not giving you your pizza"".

"Inheriting a home is a blessing, but also a curse. Here‚Äôs my experience. ‚§µÔ∏è","Let me (30f) preface this by saying I am extremely grateful and that outweighs all of the things which I am about to say.

So, title is self-explanatory. We‚Äôre set to inherit the home + acreage we‚Äôre currently living in (and paying rent for, although the mortgage is paid off). We pay rent to ‚Äúfeel ownership,‚Äù via my FIL‚Äôs terms. We‚Äôve paid minimum of $54k, max of $90k in rent to date.

Except, we‚Äôre in this weird limbo of we aren‚Äôt actually the rightful owners, we have a landlord agreement yet we don‚Äôt? When something breaks or needs to be replaced we fix or finance it. Or, my husband awkwardly ignores it because perhaps he knows this is more his father‚Äôs home than his own.

For instance, our top window panes in our windows are fogged. The house is 20+ years old. Instead of being a regular homeowner that can say, hey let‚Äôs look at financing to replace these windows, my husband avoids the topic or gets defensive when I bring it up.

You know as I‚Äôm typing this, it‚Äôs more of a spouse problem than an inheritance problem. Lol. He‚Äôs so avoidant and uninterested. He has no idea how *anything* works in the real world. No idea of financing, or insurance, and he hardly cares to pretend he wants to know anything about it.

I had to beg him to get life insurance for myself and our 3 young children. ‚ÄúIf anything ever happened to me, my dad would take care of you,‚Äù to which I replied in tears, ‚Äúyes but I didn‚Äôt marry your father I married YOU!‚Äù He claims he got some but I‚Äôm not convinced.

Y‚Äôall. This inheritance has stunted my husband to forever be a son before he‚Äôs a man. It is a blessing and a curse. 

I take care of a home that doesn‚Äôt feel entirely like mine. I can decorate and paint and put up all of the photos, but at the end of the day, I feel out of place. I, too, feel like a child who is playing house my in-law‚Äôs home.

We‚Äôll be stuck here forever. It‚Äôs gonna be home alright. Anyone who saw this land or home would smack me in the face for being ungrateful in any manner. ‚ÄúYou should be grateful!!! Look at what you‚Äôve been given!‚Äù

But it kinda feels like an arranged marriage. I had no say in the matter. The arrangement was made available and as newly-wedded 21 &amp; 26 year olds we would‚Äôve be fools not to take it. 

Nearly a decade later I‚Äôm coming to grips with the fact that moving locations is never an option. It makes me feel so closed in at times.

Idk. Blessing and a curse, like I said. I just need to enjoy what I‚Äôve been given, but coming from a first-generation Polish immigrant family who worked for everything to then see a beautiful pay-off, I romanticize that opportunity to have a clean slate and options, dreams.",r/Millennials

Does anyone else feel like a failure in their 20'ss ? I'm 29," Hi everyone i hope you're all doing fine and i also wanna wish you all a happy and fullfiling new year.

Unfortunately  for me it's been quite a few weeks now since i've been feeling really  bad about myself for a lot of different reasons, but i think it's mainly  because i'm very dissapointed in myself for not achieving more goals at  29 years old and not having my life together already. I was expecting  to have a way better life than the one i have right now.

Every  second, minute, hour, day, week, month and year that goes by makes me  feel depressed because i think that i'm running out of time and i'm  getting too old to ""catch up"" on things and try to solve many issues i'm  having in my life at the moment, such as :

\-the  fact i'm still living with my parents, i give them a bit of money every  month and they told me many times that they don't mind that i'm living  with them as long as i'm doing something with my life, but i'm still  feeling like a burden for myself and for them ;

\-for  the last 5 years i kept switching between different kind of jobs about  every year/year and a half to try and figure out what i wanna do with my  life because i tought that's how i would figure it out, but it turns  out that i'm even more lost and undecided at 29 than i was at 23/24 ;

\-i'm  also suffering from a lot of social isolation since i basically only  have one childhood friend remaining, but since he recently got married  and has he's own place now that relationship with him is kinda ""gone""  for me since he won't be having as much time to hang out with me anymore  because of his life obligations. I don't know if i should even be  surprised things turn out to be this way today, because i remember that  even as a kid i could spend hours and days locked in my room just  playing video games and watching tv with no social contact for days, so  maybe this is just a logical conclusion to that ? ;

\-and  finally that's probably the thing that makes me the most depressed,  it's the fact that i've never been in any kind of romantic relationship  with a women. The fact that i've never hold hands, kissed, cuddled, had  sex or anything with a women depresses me very deeply because i feel  like i'm an unlovable hermit loner piece of trash that doesnt deserve to  be alive and be loved because my dumbass can't even do something as  simple and basic as finding himself a girlfriend like 99% of the  population does. This nowadays causes me to put almost any decent women i  meet IRL on a pedestal and not even try to ask her out because in my  mind she's already refused a 1000 times even before i ask her out. Why  would she even bother being with a guy who has absolutely no clue about  how women work at 29 ?

Whenever i  scroll trough social media to see what the rest of my family and old  friends are up to, or when i'm outside and take a look at complete  strangers around me, i really can't help but compare myself to all those  people and even compare myself to fictionnal charachters in  movies/shows/video games and then feel like a huge POS because it seems  that absolutely everyone on this god damn planet knows exactly what they  are doing and they all have their lives perfectly well put together  except for me of course.

I also  think that this modern society in which we live in makes almost every  mental obstacle one could be having a 100x worse, because we live in a  world where nobody seems to give a damn about what you could be going  trough. Everyone is out there for themselves and only themselves and  they believe that if you have problems in life then it's your fault and  also your responsability to fix it by going to therapy for example,  which by the way i'm not againt it, in fact i took an appointment to a  new therapist next week. But there's just something so rude and  dismisive when people tell you that, it's kind of a polite way to say :  ""hey sorry i know that you're suffering but i'm not even gonna try to  help you because i'm not a professional, so you have to go see a  therapist and pay her for that.

Not feeling my age (39 years old) despite general success and meeting goals.,"An old friend recently said to me, ""In ten years, you'll be almost in your early senior years.""

For some reason I initially thought, ""You mean early 40ish is THAT old?""

She meant 49, almost 50. Almost 50ish in a decade.

In my head, I'm still somewhere between 28-32. I don't feel my age at all. Physically I'm in great shape, but when I look in the mirror, yeah I can see the hair slowly thinning and wrinkles appearing.

I think I don't feel my age because my standard of living and lifestyle are more or less what they were when I was in my twenties: living in a small apartment by myself, studying various subjects, wearing gym clothes everywhere, and going for long walks.

I got a PhD and I work as a researcher/author. I get invited to give lectures around the world. It can be an exciting life, but I still come back to my modest salary and gig contracts. 

I haven't been able to get a permanent position in a university yet. I am not afforded any respect in the universities where I've worked because I'm the equivalent of a visiting researcher.

So, no real home, no family, no kids, no property. I'm still living like a student. It is a weird place to be: I'm very successful as an author/researcher, but society and the economy haven't upgraded me to the status of a real professional.

I'd feel like a mature adult if I could afford kids and a proper home, but none of that has come my way despite whatever success I've had so far.

The thing is, there's no light at the end of the tunnel. It doesn't bother me that much, but I can see myself still living like a bachelor in my fifties unless my fortunes change.",r/Millennials

Anyone out moved back in to live with their parents? How's it work out?,"TL;DR - For those who did, how are things working out? Might as well live together happy before being forced to confront medical/age issues which will probably be a bad experience.

Typical older millennial here: Recession graduate, aging parents, career stagnation, lost in life, existential crisis, can't afford to buy a house and can't afford kids, first world problems but still problems.

The idea of moving back and living with my retired mom (dad not in picture) has been on the back of my mind for a while. For those who did, how are things working out? There are some good reasons and also selfish reasons, I'm trying to lay things out plainly even if it makes me look like an AH.

**The #1 reason is I might as well proactively move back to create good memories together first, before health &amp; elderly care issues surface and it becomes almost guaranteed misery for everyone.** (because poor health is terrible to start with).

Disclaimer: Relationship not awesome/best buds but nothing actually terrible or serious.

Selfishly, bigger household full of adults mean sharing practical responsibilities which makes things easier for everyone. She bought a two story home in a condo community (ie indoor regular upkeep only) after retirement and it's only her living there now. She's been very sedentary since retirement and I'm thinking there's multiple benefit in both sharing everyday responsibilities and also helps to keep her active (I know it sounds like turning her into a maid but let's view with an optimistic angle).

She's definitely physically able but she's hasn't been trying. She watches dramas on the phone all day with her back hunched. Initially she claimed she'll use house cleaning as her daily exercise but it did not happen, she also said she'll take piano lessons to fulfill a childhood dreams which also hasn't happened. Currently her fridge is stocked with expired ingredients that she gets too lazy to cook for herself.

MORE selfish reasons, living together and giving my mom money for rent, at least things stay within our own family's ecosystem. While I'm employed and don't have money PROBLEMS per se,   house ownership is not really on the horizon and we can all use some cost savings in our lives.

I currently live 5 hours away, I went away for college at 18 on the opposite end of the state and pretty much never looked back, I'm in my late 30's now. All those years I haven't exactly missed going home and it's still the case, my visits are pretty brief. Even during holidays in college, I rather stay in an empty cold snowy college town. So part of this is also some guilt, I know how hard she worked and I am close to tears just thinking about her getting old; but I also can't bring myself to be all buddy buddy or vulnerable like momma's boy either and be very close like other families.

I understand there will be certain annoyances but I'm also aware that my family problems had never been anything too terrible for this to be off limits. The problems of living together are all workable and closer to teenager conflicts.

Well, how did things work out for you all?

Those of you who were able to buy a home without any financial help from family - how were you able to do it and how old were you?,"I'll start.  I started looking at houses online in 2018 (I was 25).  After browsing for about 9 months I realized prices kept going up and up. I remember thinking to myself, ""if I don't buy within the next year or two, I'll never be able to afford a house at this rate.""

I was only making $15.75/hr at the time. I thought I for sure wouldn't qualify for a mortgage, but I reached out to a local lender just to see.

Turns out, surprisingly, I did qualify.  At the time the only debt I had was a $215 car payment, $61 student loan payment, and a $35/month credit card.

So I started looking around for places in the price range I was approved for (I forget exactly how much I was approved up to).

Now I will say, I do live in a US southern state where the cost of living is fairly low, but as you can see by what I was making, the jobs here also pay significantly less than most places.

After a few months of looking I found a new townhome community that had just started being built.  I ended up buying there - signed a contract in July 2019, closed in Feb 2020.

Sale price: 169k, builder gave me a 3k credit towards closing costs, got an FHA loan with 3.5% down, and was able to get a 3.875% rate.

Also, I moved out of my 1 bedroom apartment and starting sharing a 2 bedroom with a roommate to significantly cut down my housing costs so that I could save up for the 3.5% down.

Of course, timing was on my side as far as prices and interests rates, which is really how I was able to afford it. I definitely turned out to be right, where if I had waited another 2-3 years to looking into buying I wouldn't have been able to afford it. I was 27 when I closed.

So to other millennial homeowners who didn't get money from family, what's your story?

ETA: since I did an FHA loan and put down less than 10% down, I'll never be able to cancel my mortgage insurance, but with the rate I have it wouldn't make sense to try to refi to get it removed since my rate would double.",r/Millennials

Pessimism as Disinformation - be conscious of the tone of this sub.,"As we go into an election year, I‚Äôd recommend caution when reading takes that characterize life in the developed world (and anywhere really) as being on the downhill slide.



Often these takes are promoted by agenda driven actors, to promote weaponized discontent online. The goal is to sow discontent and normalized distrust of our institutions, leaders, and culture.



The fact is that people today live better lives than royalty in medieval times (‚Äúwhy are all the restaurants full? How are so many buying expensive houses and vacations?‚Äù). Most people offline are doing better than at any point in human history, but their voices are (intentionally?) ignored in the online crab bucket.

And I mean sure, the change to a new calendar year isn't something I'm necessarily excited about but with how burnt out I've been from work, I'm glad to have another day off.

That said, the best New Year's Eve I had was when the bands Sleep and Big Business played Chicago on the new years before covid and when weed became legal in Illinois.

Maybe this opinion makes me a horrible person, idk. I just feel like we were tricked into taking out these loans with the promise that we would have great jobs and be able to pay them back.

""People born between 1985 and 1995 [give or take a few years each way] are the most unique generation of all time. Here‚Äôs why:

They are in-between two generations: the one before the internet and technology took over and the generation after.

The generation before us was old school and believed in working hard. The generation after us believes in working smart.

We saw it all: Radio, TV, Mario, Waptrick, Nokia, Nintendo 64, Samsung, iPhone, PS4, Tape, CD, DVD, MIXit, MIG32, Netflix, Snapchat, Emojis, and Virtual reality‚Ä¶

The generation before us can be scammed with simple emails asking for money and offering love. The generation after us knows it‚Äôs better to have four emails: one for serious stuff, social media, financial transactions and one for experiments for things you don‚Äôt trust

We are the generation that knows tradition and question it‚Ä¶ picking from it what makes sense to us. The generation before us knew no questions. The generation after us knows no tradition.

We are the gap between the industrial age and the internet age. We understand both sides from experience. We should be running the world! The old guys don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on anymore; the new guys don‚Äôt fully understand where what‚Äôs going on came from.""



Edit: give or take a few years. Gen x is before ours. And the general point to the post (I am not the OC) Is that we have witnessed a major shift compared to the generations before ours.

"Self-esteem issues, constantly comparing myself to others and never feeling like I‚Äôm enough","I get complimented all the time. I have a loving and caring husband. Even my bosses (I have a male and female) will say I‚Äôm pretty, I know I am intelligent but I‚Äôm just constant hating, doubting, being negative towards myself. 

I did plastic surgery, I have access to pretty much everything cosmetic wise but I cannot stop comparing myself to models, bloggers, etc.

"Fyi that ""90's aesthetic"" has a name and was a design movement","The bright colors and squiggles look was a deliberate movement called Memphis Design that was started in Italy.  [https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Memphis\_Design](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Memphis_Design)

It was non-standard and ""fun"" looking so it permeated a lot of toys and entertainment aimed at kids for about 15 years.  Pretty much everything on Nickelodeon in the 90s was influenced artistically by Memphis.  These days kids incorporate the aesthetic into a genre of music called ""vaporwave"" which is supposed to simulate the memory of listening to tinny synth music being broadcast inside a mall, sort of.

Does anyone remember the YouTube-sponsored political debates in 2008?,"I thought it was the coolest shit ever.

Setting the scene: social media was booming. The danger of algorithms and personal data tracking wasn't yet really a ""big thing"" yet, Food Trucks were making a comeback by playing into the novelty of Twitter and posting their locations. Youtube didn't have ads, and most videos were low-quality America's Funniest Home Videos style. 

2008 really felt like a pivotal year in so many ways, even with the shitstorm of the great recession it felt like there was creative energies rising from the ashes of all of it. It being an election year and the end of the George W Bush Era also had something to do with it. 

Anyway. I distinctly remember watching the presidential primary debates. I think they were on CNN? Rather than moderators posing the questions, hundreds of Americans from around the country posted a question to youtube, the video of which was then played to the candidates. I thought it was fucking brilliant. 

You got a glimpse into the different lives of Americans, you got a sense of what was important to them, what they were concerned with. Hell I even thought it was cool to see inside homes, what people were doing, how people were dressed, what they sounded like. For me it felt like introducing this dimension to the debate added a level of accountability to the responses because they were addressing real people. I thought it was a great format. It really was a snapshot of the time, of when social media was still somewhat novel and innocent, brimming with possibilities of connection,  before the invention of infinite scroll and algorithm echo chambers. 

It's a bummer this format of debate never really continued. I'd love to see it back again. 

Anyone else remember watching these? What did you think about it?

"""Time Bomb Y2K"" documentary on MAX (HBO) - Millennial nostalgia trip","I just watched this documentary and really enjoyed it. It brought back so much about the '90s, all the silliness and real-world fears around Y2K during the late '90s...

Any tips for 29 year old unsure about their progress in life?,"Hey guys I‚Äôm in a southern state turning 29 in March, was wondering if you guys could give me some life advice.

Majority of my 20s I‚Äôve been trying to make money working multiple jobs and hustling to stay and ahead and managed to get my bachelors in accounting without student loans. Now I make enough to where I can pay my bills, handle family emergencies, go on trips maybe once every year or so, etc. But other than that I can‚Äôt afford my own place because well the economy and still live with my dad which I could honestly say he‚Äôs living with me based on how the bills are being split (he‚Äôs an immigrant who‚Äôs grown into a very lazy man since my mom left him, that or he‚Äôs lost his mind idk).

I really want to spend my 30s not stressing money as much and achieve more without regretting it later on maybe start my own family after traveling and having dope experiences but at the same time know that if I don‚Äôt grind some more I‚Äôm going to fall behind the way costs keep rising. I feel like when I spent all my early 20s grinding it hasn‚Äôt been as fruitful as I was expecting and wasted time chasing money and saving for the future when I should‚Äôve been chasing happiness more.

Thoughts on moving out of the US after getting a new healthcare degree,"Hello everyone. Title kind of says it all. For those that have moved out of the US to another country, how did it go for you?

I have been thinking about this for a little while now.

Would love to maybe move to a country like Italy, France or Japan.

Living with a narcissistic father and a crazy sister. I feel miserable and don‚Äôt know what to do,"I (24f) still lives with my family due to cultural reasons. For some backstory I‚Äôve always been a slim person and my younger sister who is a year younger has been heavy set throughout our childhood. At one point in January last year she accused me of being the reason she‚Äôs not losing weight because I was not encouraging her. In June of last year she stopped talking to my sisters and I because during my moms photoshoot I called her out for insulting my sister who is 4 years younger than me. She proceeds to cut us off while still living in the house and then looses so much weight that she becomes skinny which is great. Until a friend sent me a video she had posted on YouTube titled I lost weight after not speaking to my family. I am the main subject I‚Äôm that video, she accuses me of bizarre things and mind you I haven‚Äôt done anything to her the entire year!!! Like cam I catch a break? She constantly brought up my good looks since I was a kid in the video and said we treated her bad because of her weight. I love my sister so this is just insane to me because I struggled with weight issues in high school but everyone tends to forget that because I try and keep myself fit for health and aesthetic reasons.  Mind you she literally lives at home‚Ä¶ in the video she constantly brings me up and my appearance and advantage in life because of my personality and looks. I tell my parents and they proceed to do nothing. My dad also frequently last year would insult me behind my back to my sister because I didn‚Äôt want to participate in his church. I was in the ER last year and my sister and my dad didn‚Äôt care. In December I then got engaged to my boyfriend of two years and I thought in this moment my sister would put down her bitterness and stop giving me the silent treatment but no she doesn‚Äôt say congratulations and hasn‚Äôt said it up till now. Instead she tells my dad she‚Äôs going to get engaged soon and everyone should watch out ?????? And my dad had been gushing over her soon to be engagement even though she doesn‚Äôt even have a boyfriend‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. This is supposed to be an amazing time in my life and she still managed to make it about her. imagine my parents literally asked her to forgive us and I want to know what I did that she has to forgive. I feel so drained entering 2024 I don‚Äôt think I can live here this year and be happy like I‚Äôm just so unhappy to have a family like this but I also dont want to burden my fianc√©. My fianc√© is another state by the way. Also my dad called me a bitch and prostitute last year when I didn‚Äôt help with his church now I‚Äôve helped him and he‚Äôs been singing me praises‚Ä¶ what is going on?

Feeling so trapped by work and really alone in life despite best efforts.,"I'm not starting the new year off very well. I feel so exasperated and confused about what I'm meant to do. I turn 30 this year and I wanted to do a little wholesome weekend with friends. Something like renting a little cottage, going for a nice hike and cream tea, then play board games with my favourite humans.
But everyone has declined and it's made me feel so rubbish and unvalued. 

The last 10 years I've had to work so hard just to survive it's left me with limited time to cultivate friendships let alone a relationship. But the few friends I do have I invest in and they're generally good people with similar interests that I thought I really connected with. 
I feel like this person who shows up for other people but no one shows up for them. 

I feel so confused what I'm meant to do, it's been so hard to find just these few friends. With work it's such a constant battle for any company to accept normal contracted working hours and not expect loads extra. Financially I couldn't afford to take a part time job as it wouldn't cover my bills. 

I feel like I need time to invest in more friendships with people who will show up. But I'm stuck on this capitalist treadmill. I'm exhausted, burnt out and feel like the demand on me is constant without getting anything back from what I put in. 

I want to stop the treadmill and just slow everything down so I can live for a bit and connect with people.",r/Millennials
I have always been an old soul and it‚Äôs showing even more . Who misses the pen/pencil or less technically days?,"Reflecting on the past, I miss the days when life seemed simpler without technology dominating every aspect. I once shared this sentiment on Reddit, only to be met with dismissive comments that felt invalidating.

At my workplace, I stand out for preferring pen and paper in meetings while everyone else relies on their laptops. I have a soft spot for writing checks, especially when they come with charming designs.

Unlike many, I don‚Äôt indulge in much TV or social media, except for using Yelp and occasionally seeking advice or sharing my dog‚Äôs pictures on Reddit.

Cruises are a haven for me due to their limited technology‚Äîunless you pay for internet , of course I don‚Äôt.

It‚Äôs disheartening to see every school I work at encouraging heavy laptop use among students. I‚Äôve noticed a concerning decline in fundamental reading, writing, and spelling skills among older students when I try to offer therapeutic support. They are unable to read, write or spell. 

At recess sports have been banned due to kids lacking problem solving skills, social skills which often led to fights every recess in all grades. Kids now stand around being on their electronic devices. I try to teach them play at recess and they tell me I‚Äôm playing 4 square wrong xD so I had to show a few kids YouTube videos of how to play as they didn‚Äôt believe me .

Recently, I had a surprising experience at the mechanic‚Äôs: they sent me a video walkthrough of the work they did on my car. While initially shocking, I found it refreshing and appreciated their honesty and expertise.

My co workers call me on my cell phone during work instead of my room line. I only use my phone on lunch and most of the day my phone is put up. So I always get like 10 miss calls or texts. 

Back then there was no ‚Äúmisgendering‚Äù and two pronouns to address people.  It is what it is. Now when people start conversations they ask what my pronouns are . Still strange but ok. 2019 was when I learned about the importance of pronouns and still learning :)

Life is getting way more expensive. Most of our main bills have gone up.,"My parents don‚Äôt have any savings and have been calling every month for help and we have been feeling the squeeze on just about everything. Without doing a single thing different and actually cutting back a lot all of 2023 I feel crappier ending this year financially. 

Property taxes went up 5,200 annually and our mortgage company decided they also wanted to have us pay two months ahead and added it to the mortgage payment spread out for another 12 months. No we have never been late ever but this is apparently a new thing.
HOA increased $360 annually
Water bill went up $40- $50 monthly
Internet from $50.25 to 70.36 monthly
Car insurance $315 to $546 monthly (3 cars on insurance including MILs) 
Electricity $80-100 up monthly despite me working and not being at home unlike the other years
My youngest sons daycare was supposed to go down to $650 due to being in an older group but instead it went up to $928 
My twins public school decided this was the year to start charging for pre k 4 for $500 each not including after school care and lunch bringing our total to $1,500 extra expense per month and also for the short months of school like December  November or March it‚Äôs still a full price and you have to pay other care services or hope family is available to help because you can‚Äôt always take time off during all of their holidays. 
I didn‚Äôt get my nails done all year and I finally got yesterday for the first time since November 2022 and I kid you not I went to the cheapest place I could find near me and it was still $65 and the machine had started at 15% tip with a no tip option. 
There‚Äôs so many more things but these are the basics. I feel like selling our house and living in an RV with solar panels with as little expenses as possible. Rant over.

Edit: since there‚Äôs some assumptions I‚Äôll add we max out our 401k, HSA, contribute to kids 529s, and save every paycheck.

Oh, and find a partner and start a family, bc it‚Äôs about time (quote from a much beloved family), but that‚Äôs an other story.

I think I am the clich√© of our generation, I did everything the way it was said we should do. I moved to the city, did the university, changed job a few times, worked a lot and got promoted on a regular basis.

Does anyone else notice how impossible it is to have kids in public spaces?,"So, I have been surfing üåä the internet (as I do) and sort of noticed lately there is a lot of chatter about gen alpha being ""the worst"". I have noticed people in general have so few third spaces to gather in, and then within those spaces it seems people are increasingly intolerant to children being there. Apparently in South Korea they have adopted a sign for places that expressly excluded them. In north America I have noticed this trend of child free weddings, and they say well I spent x dollars to have this and I don't want your snotty kid ruining the day. Weddings are about bringing two families together, and celebrating that fact. Children are a part of the family. (No I don't need ur hot take on why your childless wedding was permissible cause of whatever exception, it's not relevant to my overall point and this general trend)
I could go off on a tangent about how removing children is inherently sexist as it excludes (mostly) mother's from public spaces and social gatherings.


I'm not sure what is driving this behaviour and trend, but the ironic part is that when parents then bring their kids to dinner, if they aren't perfectly behaved you're a terrible mother/parent, but if u ""shove and iPad in their face"" you're also a terrible parent. Like speaking as a parent it's incredibly frustrating to see childless gen z and millenials go out of their way to exclude and even degrade kids. 

I'm curious, has anyone else noticed this trend? Is this a natural consequence of the extreme individualism we have fostered in society where what I feel is paramount over a more inclusive environment?

Edit: I can see the post is downvoted to oblivion so before it's deleted I just wanted to note how interesting it is that being downvoted would imply its just as easy as it ever was to bring kids out in public, and yet a lot of the comments have entirely missed the point become defensive and then couched their intolerance of children in this idea that they've had a bad experience in public with kids and so that somehow justifies their entire worldview on the matter now, and have failed to engage with the subject of the post. People are less tolerant of children now because we don't a) beat them and b) parents are bad parents so kids are running amok and don't deserve to be included. Those are the most common retorts. These fail to realize that being a modern parent is the most lonely time to bring a child up with rising daycare, cost of living, cost of extra curricular, and the lack of family support a lot of parents face. There is this feeling of being entitled to a quiet undisturbed experience wherever u go, and that is frankly giving the ick. Aggressively shouting well u decided to have kids so now u deserve to be ostracized seems to me, extremely exclusionary. I hope if u downvoted over wanting a childfree wedding u can stretch yourself a bit mentally and examine the sentiment and get beyond the example. ",r/Millennials

"Your mentality is the problem, and you could at least try fixing it.","ETA TL;DR You can be sad and also live a beautiful fulfilling life. I'm going to add an emboldened notation below which indicates the beginning of my therapist's advice. Still a chunk, but worth reading.

EDIT 2: If you're downvoting I want you to comment providing a reason why. Others are finding this advice to be valuable and you're taking away the ability of this advice to help others for reasons I don't understand. 

Not just in this sub, but in quite a few (and it just comes with this time of year), a lot of people have been complaining that they feel like they've wasted the year and that the new year can't possibly bring them anything good or worth sticking around for.

And that's a horrible mentality. I'm sharing because I noticed it in myself. Just a few years ago I would have catastrophized this Christmas and New Years, turning them into this big sad mess which I should obviously feel sad about. But simply because you have stuff to feel bad about, doesn't mean you have to.

On Christmas I got some ambience lights and a Christmas card. That's it. The Christmas lights were a re-gift, and the card is a duplicate that I have already from my father. And boohoo, how sad is that? Except, it's not. I spent most of the day with my family, and I enjoyed it. I told them I loved them, and they told me they loved me. Which I know is more than others had. But it's definitely less than what others had, and I certainly could have turned Christmas into a mess and cried about it.

On New Years I was planning on having dinner at my aunt's house and ringing in the new year - unfortunately I got very sick, I'm still recovering. Which meant that I couldn't go anywhere. I spent New Years texting my brother that I missed him and loved him, and falling asleep at 9 pm on a maximum dose of cold medicine feeling like I'd swallowed razor blades and injected jello into my sinuses, coughing myself into tunnel vision and hoping that it wouldn't get worse to necessitate a visit to the hospital. I couldn't even do what I was most grateful for - I couldn't go spend it with my family and just be near them as we rang in the new year. Heck, I didn't even stay up to watch the ball drop. I could've turned that into a mess and cried about it.

But I didn't. And no, it's not because I'm some chemically balanced normie. I have depression, hospitalizations and the whole 9 yards. But, because I know myself and know that \*I do catastrophize...\*I also know that *I have to strategize* and try to win this battle. So what'd I do instead? I realized immediately upon waking up, that no matter how shitty I felt, as long as I felt better in the next hour and the hour after that, that this year is literally just going to keep getting better and better. I'll feel it physically, I'll notice it the entire way.

**Therapist's advice begins here**

I saw something funny that was meant to be a joke, ""Please just share your therapist's advice and save me the trouble"" or something. Here's mine:

""Life doesn't give you disasters, YOU make them."" (At this point I pushed back and argued a close death in the family is inarguably a disaster. It ruins lives.)

""People die all the time though. And it's horrible, but if that's a disaster every time, then why doesn't the same thing that's happening to you, happen to everybody, across multiple cultures, across multiple timeframes?"" (I admit it's not a universal thing but ask for a tangible example to seat in the lesson)

""Think of life kind of like an ingredient dispenser. It's just this box, and it spits stuff out at you. Sometimes faster or slower, sometimes good ingredients, some of them are pretty meh, and others are just atrocious and you don't know what to do with them, maybe they're spoiled or bitter tasting. Okay, you have a death in the family, the ingredients are sadness, loneliness, and creativity. And these taste bitter, sour, and sweet. And there's a lot of sadness and loneliness but there's not very much creativity. Along the way you have other life events, so it spits out a bunch of other ingredients as well.

The Upcoming Form of Millennial Burnout: Parental Caregiving/Care Management,"My sister raised an excellent point. She said, ""I can't wait for the articles in 10 years about burnout from caregiving for ailing Boomers.""

Note that her use of caregiving is broad and covers ""care management (wrangling doctors, an attorney, various banks/insurance companies/service providers/etc)"" as well as the more customary helping out with various domestic tasks. 

We're going through this early with our dad's (63) late stage ALS. He...did everything wrong (read: nothing) in planning. We're also in one of the worst possible positions - not on great terms, poor communication styles. After Dad elected to ""save me at any cost"" while in the hospital (we were hoping he'd just...not) right before Christmas, we've been scrambling to do months of paperwork in weeks...during the holidays. 

If you have low-functioning boomer parents, you're in for a ride.

A typical-ish day for us recently has included: 3-ish hours of round-trip driving to Dad's hospital; ""translating"" dad's mouth movements and/or ""handwriting;"" explaining for the umpteenth time that **his choice** to be trach'ed and ventilated means that he we can't give him a diet coke; the various physical agonies; seeing my sister break into tears again; getting the newest doctor/social worker up to speed when his team changes due to a shift between rehab/ICU/non-critical care.  

A non-hospital day will include an attorney call; having to explain to Dad's siblings (for the umpteenth) that all medicaid-eligible nursing homes suck; a visit to Dad's home of hoarding horrors to locate documents; sitting on the phone with some entity to register a PoA; figuring out how to cancel various subscriptions; remembering that we can't do jack shit (online) due to Dad having his phone at the hospital and every BS service using 2FA.",r/Millennials

The 90s weren't some magical Utopia... You were just young then.,"This is in response to the recent post that said ""I cannot conceptionalize how we went from the awesomeness of the '90s to the s\*\*\* show that we're seeing today"". Obviously there are a lot of factors involved, the world changed post 9/11, social media means we're exposed to a lot more horrific things than ever before not to mention echo chambers. There were some really good comments explaining the ways in which life was better for some people during the 90s. But the same could be said about today if you cherry pick the good stuff.

Here's a list of ways the 90s was a shit show in no particular order. Feel free to add your own.

Rodney King and the LA riots

The Waco Seige

The Oklahoma City bombing

World Trade Center bombing

The AIDS crisis

The North Korean Famine

The hole in the Ozone layer

The Gulf War and the Oil Spill

The Yugoslav Wars

The Kosovo War

The Chechen-Russian conflict

The Bosnian Genocide

The Troubles (Northern Ireland)

Civil wars - Sri Lanka, Rwanda, Somalia, Sierra Leone, Djibouti, Algeria, Afghanistan, Burundi, Iraq, Congo... the list goes on

Heaven's Gate mass suicide

The shooting at Columbine

This isn't even including natural disasters, recessions or political scandals. The main difference is that back when all this was going on we were busy watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and sipping on juice boxes at the start of the decade and watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and sneaking booze at the end of it.

The 90s weren't good or bad, better or worse, they were just the years when we were young and carefree.

Anyone remember anything related to an obscure ‚ÄúGurdy Gurgle‚Äù kids song?,"Anyone remember a children‚Äôs show or special in the late 80s or early 90‚Äôs that had a kids song with lyrics: 

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs slippery and slimy and gritty and grimy. She must have been the dirtiest Gurdy Gurgle I‚Äôve ever seen.‚Äù

My brother and I (83 and 85) used to rent a kids show or kids tv special on VHS in the late 80s or early 90s from the library and have very vague recollections about it like a fever dream but my brother has an occasional ear worm with those lyrics and we can‚Äôt seem to find anything related when googling.

"I (36f) developed tinnitus at barely 34, &amp; no one can relate","I'm 36, was 34 at age of onset. Had a bad double ear infection during the super bowl 2022. I could barely hear people and phones ringing in the nurses station, bad. 2 rounds of strong antibiotics later it was gone. Barely. I grew up with them constantly. Don't know why I never got tubes. But my ears kept ringing. And ringing after this last, terrible ear infection. 

I work in nursing and always see older patients with this great ailment of tinnitus, working in loud environments for years, menieres dz. If it's someone younger, it's definitely not in their chart. My SIL who's ?18 years older than me has it. But she's older than me. 

TLDR; I've had tinnitus for the last 2 years. My right ear (much worse) is near constant. It will get worse, normal, repeat. Don't know when, etc. I've had the Dr I work for look in it and he said both of my ears look great and all a Dr would do is a hearing test and could get hearing aids to balance things out. It helped my coworkers husband.

now this was from 2019 but if things just go up to the moon with no regression than millennials that are high performers blow gen x and even boomers out of the water in terms of top earning potential. 

just to sum it up for you if you didn't feel like going through the article

  **Four percent of millennials said they earned $250,000, compared to 3% of Gen X-ers and 1% of boomers.

Can we talk about screen time back when we were kids vs. now?,"I‚Äôm a 30 yo millennial here, just spent about a week holiday with my niece who is 6 years old. I don‚Äôt have any kids yet so I might not know what is up with these days, and her parents are making a valiant effort to keep her off the screens as much as possible. 

However, without the screens she is very much hyperactive and has a very short attention span. Her parents are going a bit looney keeping her entertained from 6am to 8pm. 

The chaos reminded me of when I was her age, I may have been up at 6/7am but for 2-3 hours on non-school mornings, I would eat cereal and watch cartoons until my parents were up and ready to do whatever we had planned for the day. Many times in the evening we would also watch a movie or I‚Äôd play something on the N64. I never thought of it as excessive screen time and I wasn‚Äôt out of control without the screens. 

It seems that most parents (who are against iPad kids) aren‚Äôt doing that and limiting screen time to about an hour per day. Then they‚Äôre driving themselves crazy trying to keep a child entertained all day. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm starting to think there‚Äôs a huge difference between iPad screens and TV screens. With the iPad, you have individual games that may be overstimulating, and curated content you don‚Äôt have to watch with anyone else. With the TV, you would just have to deal with whatever is on, or agree with the siblings on what to watch. Go to blockbuster with your parents and pick out a movie. Back in my day üëµüèª you couldn‚Äôt take the TV with you, so you still learned and dealt with how to behave in public. iPads you can take with you and kids can more easily ignore what‚Äôs going on in the real world, so I could see why the iPads are problematic.

I think most people here genuinely want to be positive but the external and systemic factors keep getting in the way.,"So I see a lot of comments and posts about how this sub is too pessimistic and negative so people leave. And I totally get it because spending too much time with negativity whether it's here, the online dating subreddit, or the news in general, that it can put you in a negative headspace.

And as someone who has struggled with rumination and dwelling on negative things from the past, especially during covid, therapy has taught me how to be present and find coping mechanisms to improve my situation and feel better.

That said, I think some of the things I've experienced that may be relatable to millennials and other generations for that matter are below as follows.

1. Excessive burnout from work. For example, I've been wanting to get out of my sales job for awhile as the company I work for sucks. The pay is trash and it's one of those toxic companies that would spew things like ""We're a family"" and give you 100 pizza parties before giving raises/promotions. The thing that makes it so exhausting is that my success is all based on timing and luck. Putting effort in was never an issue. But unless someone wants your product, most of the time you get rejected. I know I need a better job, but I find that a lot of times when I get off work, I am too burnt out to apply for others. Hell sometimes even playing a video game, watching a movie, or getting the energy to go to the gym feels like a chore in itself due to the burnout and it sucks. Like what's the point of buying things if you are too exhausted to use them? I really wanna get out of sales, but don't know what to do. I'm sick of needing additional sources of income just so I have money for my hobbies. The few times I've called recruiters, they never answered nor did they return calls after I left a voicemail.
2. Online dating and dating culture with people multi dating and feeling overwhelmed with too many options. I know everyone's experiences vary. But I feel like when people are interested, they're all interested aka the paradox of choice. And it's never pleasant to reject somebody when you find someone you're more interested in, even if the other person did nothing wrong.
3. This falls under the first one, but with wages stagnating and costs of living such as food, rent, insurance, etc. Because I didn't get a christmas bonus this year, unlike the last 2, that made my christmas more stressful. I got gifts for my parents 2 of my brothers,  but I felt like a cheapass as my budget was $25 per person. I'm hoping to pay down debt, but I feel like the way with the system is working, it's like I feel like I have to choose between having fun and saving/paying down debt. I do have some savings in my bank account but I don't feel comfortable paying down all my debt as my money is in the bank for a rainy day fund and other things of course. I mean I have a degree and work a full time job. Why can't this be enough?

I can't speak for others but again, I think it's situations like these is why our generation is burnt out, and I wanna get out of this rut, but how?

95 Millennial; Anyone else slowly weening themselves digitally?,"**Facebook**: Deleted Facebook back in maybe 2013. There was just no point anymore and by that point it was already a cesspool. The *idea* of keeping up with family is cool but at the same...do i really care what my second cousin whose been to jail 20+ times is up to? I damn near missed my 10 year Highschool reunion because the invites were only sent on Facebook, thankfully my friend groupchat let us all know.

**Twitter/X:** It was bad enough during the 2016 election, but once the pandemic rolled around i finally was ready to pull the plug. I briefly returned and its just not fun anymore. Maybe it was more fun back in college/High School when we had our little local Twitter space. 

**Instagram:** Deactivated it last night. I sincerely don't see the point and the search page is just Tiktok lite. Might go back because i enjoy meme pages but thats really it. I also really don't like Meta's practices.

**Discord:** Tried to get into some communities but i don't feel much connection digitally. Maybe for a smaller niche community but i'm over it. My friend use discord to hang out but i've been sitting out on that because i'd rather just...talk in person.

**Dodged Bullets:** Snapchat, Tiktok, Vine. Never got into them, didn't see the point.

**Dating Apps:** All of them, they just suck. It feels very fake. I'd rather just go to speed dating. Fun fact: [Match Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_Group) owns Tinder, Hinge, Ok Cupid, and Plenty of Fish.

It is interesting that people are always talking about a loneliness epidemic and at the same time we use all these various apps to facilitate interactions that would otherwise have to be in person.

Did anyone else have teachers that would have you role play being kidnapped?,"My 3rd grade teacher who 4 times over the course of the year, would randomly interrupt his lesson and tell us to take out a piece of paper and a pencil. He would give a scenario such as:

&amp;#x200B;

You are at the store and a man with black hair and a mustache walks up to you pretending to be the father of one of your friends. He calls Brayden, but your name is Jayden, you correct him and you both laugh over the misunderstanding. He offers you a ride home and you accept and he takes you to his white 4 door car and puts you in the back seat. You get to talking with him and lose track of time and before you know it are on the freeway. You crack the window open a bit and realize the speed you are going. You go silent. ""I'm not going to hurt you, don't worry. Once we make it to Oregon, everything will be fine.""   He continues driving while you are desperately looking around without drawing attention. You look down and see there is a receipt and a sharpie on the ground. After a few miles the man takes an exit, pulls into a gas station to fill up. He steps out and locks the doors. ""Stay here."" He walks inside to pay for the fuel. 

Ok class, you have 2 minutes to write a note to help save yourself while the man is paying for gas and you are left alone. 

After two minutes, he would say pencils down, collect them, read a couple, we would vote if the note saved the kid or not. We were ruthless the first time. Like one survivor or something like that. But it gave us all the basic idea on what to write next time. So next time like 60% of the class got it right. Third time like 80% and final time I think we just pretended everyone got it, cuz I'm pretty sure a few kids still didn't. 

Regardless, it was empowering. School shootings weren't yet a worry (born 82), so getting kidnapped was what a lot of us thought was the most likely bad thing to happen to us. Made us all feel like we could handle it after that.

"How ""tech enthusiast"" are you...how much have you adopted technology into your life?","
38M

Got introduced to my first Desktop computer around 1994-1995 when I was around 10 years old.

I love to be up to date in terms of technology, using as many digital devices as possible. 

-  Smart Home: mostly controlled by voice commands/remotely through Alexa (ligths, smart bulbs, switches, TV, Areas, etc.)
- I can't have a car without the latest Head Unit Dashboard, fully WiFi connected, able to watch Netflix, YouTube etc.
- Latest smartphone with the best performance overall for regular use, gaming.
- Pet: I have a cat and he's totally self-service: automated food dispenser, automated water dispenser, automatic self-cleaning litter box, eBo BOT WiFi Camera Pet Toy

I LOVE WFH and even back in 2007 I knew it was possible to do so, so I consider myself an early WFH adopter.

I'm pro technology.

However my two brothers, one from 1983 (early Millenial) and 1979 (Late GenX) they could care less about tech eventhough we were raised in the same household with the same 'tech conditions"" back in the day.

There should be a documentary on body image issues stemming from the 90s/00s,"I know we talk about body image issues a lot here, but I was just thinking that if there were a documentary about this, perhaps it would bring light to all the harms caused during many of our childhoods, and provide a historic relic of one of our generation‚Äôs defining characteristics: the unrelenting struggle with body image in the world of processed foods. 

There will always be body image issues, but the intense scrutiny that many millennials experienced growing up should be a warning sign.  Sadly, it‚Äôs extremely ‚Äúmillennial‚Äù to *still* struggle with disordered relationships surrounding food, and the youngest of our generation are nearing 30.  To have been a millennial kid/teen is to have been exposed to impossible body expectations.  You were either too thin or too fat.  Social media has laid a similar trap for Gen Z, but thankfully they also have competing narratives that were totally unavailable to us (body positivity/neutrality, as well as a focus on health that encourages proper nutrition and weight-lifting).  This isn‚Äôt to discredit their issues, but to warn them from losing that balance in their perspectives, and to keep on the road of body neutrality.  How amazing is it that the message is out there to focus on how their body feels and what it does rather than how it looks?

Think of all the celebrities who could speak to this: Jessica Simpson, Tyra Banks, Britney Spears, Hilary Duff, Nicole Richie, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Raven Simone, Brendan Fraser, and on and on.  And that‚Äôs not even touching the regular joes!!!!  It would be so powerful to flip the script on that history.  It would also give historical context for the body positivity and body neutrality movements.

Unfortunately, this is a characteristic of the millennial experience.  Hopefully this cultural relic never befalls another generation to the extent that it came for us in every magazine, movie, and form of media.  Our parents had it bad, too, but we had the abundance of processed foods that held us back before we knew about nutrition.  Documenting this could empower future generations, even if body image issues will always exist.

Edit:  This post is not an endorsement of ~~HAES~~ radical fat acceptance, and is more about body neutrality than ‚Äúbody positivity‚Äù which has also glorified different unhealthy choices.",r/Millennials

Should we create a robot Ewok race to help stop the trash crisis?,"   AI and robotics are on the rise and will be significant factors in our lives this century. So how can we harness this technology to help us alleviate some of the problems on earth? 
  With the trash and pollution problem, I think we're going to go beyond just using human resources to solve this problem. We may initially start with just people, but then throw tech into the mix to solve the problem faster and more effectively.
   One idea is to build an entire robot race of humanoid Ewoks who are programmed to mine and harvest garbage to sort and extract potentially valuable resources for recycling. They're programmed to mine and earn income and that income is used to reproduce the Ewok race. They can also learn different ways to do their tasks faster and more efficiently and use tools to manage trash piles.     
   Expert management and recycling of trash is the DNA code of their race. Each humanoid robot is created as an individual with same source code DNA. They're not easily hackable as they are based on a decentralized blockchain system, but they do communicate and cooperate to work on goals for the whole of their group.
   These robots are not human level intelligent because they don't have a broad understanding or general knowledge of things but are experts at a narrow subject and field. They see the trash and they know what to do.",r/Millennials

"Weird Time in Life for Me, but looking toward a bright 2024....","Little back history: Married &amp; had a baby at 21, husband was active duty military. At 24 (2008), I lost husband &amp; daughter when we were hit head on by a drunk. In 2011 I moved to FL with my partner. (I'm 40, calling him a boyfriend is weird to me). 

I'm losing my home. I won't default on a mortgage, I just got behind in property taxes. Anyway, this is the weird part, at least to me. 

The few friends and family that know all the particulars are just devastated. Me? I don't care. It's just a house, a very expensive materialistic thing. Something that most work hard to achieve. However, for me, when my husband and daughter died, I stopped putting so much stock into materialistic things. I'd rather my husband be alive and us moving from duty station to duty station. 

I'm not going into all the specifics but I'm not walking away empty handed, I am getting a sizable chunk of money. This is where this whole issue became a blessing. 

If I'm completely honest, I've been miserable where I'm currently living pretty much since COVID. This gives me the chance to move back to my home state and be near people who love me &amp; support me.

 I had only moved to where I currently am because my grief was so bad, that everything in my hometown reminded me of what had happened. The fatality crash was all over the news, newspapers wrote about it, etc. 

But now? I'm just done. I don't want to be here anymore and I'm counting down the days til I'm 45 minutes from my best friend &amp; 2.5 hours from my hometown &amp; where my husband and daughter are laid to rest. 

If you're curious as to why I'm not closer to home, well it's hard to find places that accept rotties, but I got lucky with our new place. 

I'll have enough in the bank after moving expenses to cover rent for at least 2 years. My biggest bill aside from rent will be my car payment. 

I'll start back to college in the summer and my GI Bill benefits will start back up. I had to take spring semester off to get moved. 

I don't look at this as a bad thing. Most people would be devastated. I just wanna be near people that love &amp; support me. After losing a spouse &amp; child, this is just a speed bump.

My brother lives in the same HCOL area as my dad; I live in a different HCOL area several states away. My mother (they have a complicated relationship) lives in what I thought was a LCOL area.

Small houses in the LCOL area (how I found out it was no longer truly LCOL); prefabricated houses (apparently, it is no longer affordable to live in a trailer park, holy hell), 55+ living communities (also, holy hell), small apartments or other rentals in the suburbs (again, sheeeesh).

This could be the depression talking (lmao us millennials and our mental illnesses), but I just cannot seem to make and keep good friends now that I‚Äôm post graduation and post religion. Maybe it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm a father, or maybe it‚Äôs because I gave up social media (this not included).

Millenials who make under $50k - what do you do for work and how are you doing?,"This one is for the rest of us. I‚Äôve seen a lot of the over $100k discussions and recently the middle ground 50-100 discussion but none about the under $50k club. 

I‚Äôm in my mid 30s and work from home in tech support for $39k/year. No degree but also no debt at all. Paid off vehicle and I rent. Happily childfree. Essentially living paycheck to paycheck but I‚Äôm searching for a better job‚Ä¶seems like I‚Äôve been doing that for about 15 years now though.

"I think we could be remembered as a great generation; ""this is our time"" my fellow goonies","Yes, we have been maligned by ""news"" articles since we were teenagers for just about everything. Not working hard enough, quitting jobs for better ones, not spending money for over inflated luxuries... But what no one likes to talk about is how resilient we are. We had student loans and empty promises of rewards for military service pedaled to us in school growing up. We were fed propaganda, we saw the elder generation prop up dying industries and failed policies with bailout after bailout. We were on the forefront of a societal shift as we entered adulthood and the world went from insular to globally aware.

But what of it all? Despite being a generation that has served in decades of ongoing wars, been saddled with debt, and only ever experienced a mediocre economy, we are making headway. Compared to older and younger generations (painting with broad strokes), we're educated, we're hard working, we're practically skilled, and we distrust party politics. Despite being held back, we're starting to reach positions of leadership. Despite our disadvantages we're starting to scratch our way into financial stability. Despite being set up for failure, we're becoming good parents, aunts, and uncles.

What we really need to do to change things further is start to vote- and not just in the big elections and along party lines. Most of us avoid voting except for major elections because we've become politically cynical, and typically are motivated by ""choosing the lesser or two evils."" We need to stop this- we need to start running for office, we need to start nominating qualified candidates. We need to show up for primaries and local elections and make ourselves heard, not just show up every four years to vote for the least worst geriatric presidental candidate.

If we can just keep pushing to better ourselves, I really think posterity will show us for what we are: a hard working generation of resilient souls that can discuss history and literature, fix your computer, keep an old car running, and DiY rennovate and maintain homes out of necessity. We've fought in wars we had no business in, we've become educated and self aware, we've held practical jobs below our qualifications to survive, we put our kid's needs before our own. 

I truly think that in time, we could become known as one of the ""great generations.""",r/Millennials

This is just to see if anyone else feels the same way I do. I have so many things to discuss - I feel like we have a unique perspective on things happening and I want to know others as well,"**‚ÄúOne day, when you‚Äôre older and wiser‚Ä¶..‚Äù**

I cannot tell you how many times I heard this as a kid, as a teen, as a young adult, but I don‚Äôt hear it anymore.

It‚Äôs not that I talk to fewer ‚Äúelders‚Äù, but they don‚Äôt tell me this anymore. I dont know if it‚Äôs because im already supposed to be there, and they can just tell I‚Äôm not, or if it‚Äôs because they are finally realizing that this phrase is a crock of shit, or if it‚Äôs because I verbally threaten them with their already-concluding lives if they even THINK about saying it.¬†  
Obviously, I‚Äôm joking‚Ä¶. but I have become quick to respond to this unearned bit of¬†arrogance with something along the lines of ‚Äúoh yeah? this country is on the brink of total collapse¬†because of who‚Äôs systems put into place? Greatest generation my ass.‚Äù¬†  
again, kidding, but it is quite¬†intentionally made clear that I shall not be subscribing to this ridiculous claim from ‚Äúyou or anyone else.""  
Here is how, based on my own experience and observation, that statement should go, if spoken in complete earnest:  
""**With age comes debt,¬†hemorrhoids and the realization that just about everything you know is wrong.... also sarcasm.""**  
Not to discredit the situational merit of ""experience"", but I'd hardly call the good judgement not to eat gas station tuna sandwiches after recalling the montezuma's revenge race against time on your way home from work that one time ""wisdom"".  
But, in fairness,¬†I guess we should outline the parameters here. My good friends, George and Charles Merriam, and Noah Webster define Wisdom as ""the¬†quality of having experience, knowledge and good judgement.""¬†I have already stated that¬†I secede to experience, but good judgement is a byproduct of experience, and an optional one at that. the ringer here is 'Knowledge' - ""the fact or condition of KNOWING something by experience or association.""¬†there's that word again, experience.¬†  
Now,¬†I was also told, wise men ""question everything"" and, my favorite revision of the old saying ""great¬†minds think alike"" to what¬†I now prefer in conversation: ""great minds think for themselves."" right alongside these were: ""it is always the loudest who voice only their ignorance"", my father's words (origin unknown), It is better to keep your mouth shut and have everyone think you a fool, than to open your mouth and prove it."" another one pops said often was ""if you are the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room.""  


# ""if you are the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room.""

This one resonates in me still to this day. I constantly seek knowledge, wisdom, faith, in everything¬†I do, but recently it hit me: if there ever were truly wise and intelligent people, and¬†they practiced the content of these previous quotes, then it seems only logical that they were not quick t¬†share this wisdom, and most if not all true wisdom would have died with them, leaving only the blowhards who loved the sound of their own voices just a little more than the accolades they received from those who bought their snake oil.¬†

and, of course, in voicing these half-concocted ""truths"" that made just enough sense on a¬†personal level to the simple-minded blowhards of the next generation, many half-truths and/or theories/beliefs, ""facts"" became common ""knowledge"". MY point being, one can¬†certainly take away the wrong knowledge from any given experience and¬†testify to anyone¬†that will listen¬†incomplete, incorrect or invented facts, lies, and misconceptions. and most of these¬†Knowledge nuggets were given to them in a time when it was the most convenient truth for whatever was troubling them at the time.¬†

Fast-forward to¬†the age of social media and bandwagon beliefs. Now, the gift of gab is not necessarily needed to influence the already weak and distracted minds of the masses.

all one needs now is SEO, the right content based on what¬†someone else said already, and/or the marketing money and false validations of crafty¬†people with attractively packaged¬†self-serving agendas and the circle of life continues.....

im¬†not getting off topic, just touching on causes that are for another discussion.¬†I have said all this to say this: ""whoever says 'with age comes wisdom' is either willfully ignorant or just a product of more¬†spoon-fed 'knowledge"".

Im certainly older, but¬†I feel like¬†I know less and less every day,¬†whether because of new data proving my assumptions wrong, or new data invented to back up something or some one or some group to get something or someone or some....thing.....

If¬†you've made it this far, share your¬†thoughts, your wisdom, knowledge, theories, whatever...

Just let me know im not really alone in the maelstrom... until next time, think for yourself, and question everything.

"Early 90 millennials do you all feel they don't culturally respect our contributions to ""what is a millennial""","I feel like those born from 1990-1993  don't get enough recognition for our contributions that defined millennial culture. 

I know it sounds petty but I was just thinking how  in some generation topics all the credit goes to the 80s millennials and while I enjoy the 80s millennials,  I think the early 90 millennials need to be recognized up in here lol! 

Honestly when I think if a text book millennial I think of people born from 88-1993

Our parents are late boomers or boomers and early gen X (1965-1969) aka the boomer lites ü§£ü§£

Like we completely made the social media culture you see today. 
We were on myspace in high school
Late Teens or college aged on early twitter. I created my Twitter in 2009 when I was 17 and lost the password and created new one in 2011
We also dominated Facebook in the later 2000s and most of us still have those embarassing posts from our teen and college years that gets posted every so often and we cringe 

We were on early IG as well and the first teens on YouTube 

We also pioneered Meme culture of the late 2000s early 10s

And not to mention we also had Nokias, flip phones, and the first wave of smart phones all of this in a span from middle school, high school, and college 
I got a Nokia around 2004 when I was in middle school followed by a flip phone in 2005 and I got my first smart phone around 09 or 2010

We also created the texting culture as teens  and most of us also had text based phones in the 2000s

Who can forget having and MP3 player and an ipod 
Being the last to have had a cassette player, CD player
 We came of age during so many tech changes but we manage to work them all with ease from the floppy disk,  drives, and clouds. 
Vhs, dvd's, Blu ray, and streaming 
We were wearing office clothes to clubs in the late 2000s and early 10s ü§£ü§£ü§£

And when I think about all the current movements gen Z now wear as a personality trait we pioneered those movements in the early 10s while in college 

-body positivity 
-safe space 
-black lives matter as most of use was in college during the death of Trayvon Martin. Definitely redefining moment for many black millennials who were just being born during the Rodney King incident. 

Like come on! Give us our just due in the generation conversations please lol

Cable TV Alternative Idea that worked for my Grandmother &amp; maybe your grandparents too,"Hope this helps anyone with a similar struggle as we take care of our aging parents &amp; grandparents.

We swapped our Oma's TV for a Samsung Smart TV to replace her cable with the Samsung TV plus app and she loves it.

My Oma is in her mid-70s and is disabled. She spends most of her time at home talking to people on the phone or watching TV. She has a smart TV but does not understand how to navigate to or use streaming apps. So she stuck with cable.

I noticed the last time I visited her she only has access to 20 channels, but it looks like only 5. I don't know and she did not remember what her channels were.

I had idea to get swap her TV for a Samsung smart TV for the Samsung TV plus app.

* It's interface looks and functions like regular cable TV. Should be a small learning curve if any.
* The Samsung TV app comes up automatically when you turn the TV on. She doesn't have to navigate to it.
* The app is free with tons of channels included. Including the thing she already watches.

I made her a channel list booklet from all from all of the channels listed in this article.  
[https://www.ytechb.com/samsung-tv-plus-channels-list/](https://www.ytechb.com/samsung-tv-plus-channels-list/) 

We swapped out her TV and she loves it.   
She was so excited and said ""I'm glad I have a TV before winter"" because she hardly had anything to watch with her cable package.

We are canceling her cable and switching her Internet provider. They were charging so much for unnecessary service visits, turning on more channels previously, and she for some reason had the fastest internet package. Mind you my Oma only used the internet on her cell phone.

"How did Columbine affect how you were treated in school? (By other students, teachers, administration, etc.)","I‚Äôm an ‚Äò82 baby (41 yo woman) and was a junior in a Catholic prep school. Columbine came on the heels of a handful of recent shootings, but was by far the most serious and shocking to that date. 

Put briefly, I was already an outcast prior to the massacre, and the target of the school‚Äôs admin for my outspoken atheism and ‚Äúgallows‚Äù humor (admittedly ill-advised in many contexts). I had already been expelled for being an alleged insubordinate threat, and quickly/desperately readmitted, by my sophomore year. 

Columbine made my social safety far worse. Before that event, I was considered weird, and there were baseless concerns I would attempt to take my life in the footprints of a student who‚Äôd died that way before I‚Äôd started attending the school. Afterwards, the admin worried without evidence that I was dangerous to other people. 

The level of surveillance put on weirdos was absurd for the early days of the internet, although we‚Äôve culturally since (d)evolved to spy on all children. The proctors took handwritten notes about my behavior in the commons at lunch, the counseling department interrogated the few friends I had, and it all was filed in an old-school cabinet of records. 

I felt terrible for anyone who‚Äôd worn a trench coat as a style choice. There were articles in periodical rags that amounted to trope-y vilification. We had a dress code, but everything was treated as coded. 

To oversimplify, I was able to get the school authorities partly off my back by proving myself smart with test scores and raising my grades to straight ‚ÄúA‚Äùs. They still, however, followed me closely. 

It was a paranoia-fueled, invasive situation. However, I think the desensitization‚Äîand the mental health stressors kids experience today as a consequence‚Äîcreate an environment that‚Äôs probably even worse.",r/Millennials

Accent chairs, accent tables, too many nightstands, chests full of stuff, and half of the homegoods store.
I swear there's not one wall that doesn't have five or six pieces of Marshall's wall art or plaques with live laugh love type sayings.
Every shelf has 30 little tchotchkes on it. From a wooden duck with a wreath around its neck to a 2-in tall crystal angel. And there are just baskets of stuff everywhere. And so many towels. Every towel bar has like seven decorative towels on it. My mom even has a towel bar that has towels tied up into loops and there are other towels rolled up inside of the towels. And then there are big ribbons on the towels.
Back of the toilet has a tray with 14 random boxes, flowers, decorative soaps, and decorative lotions on it. Plus the lid of the toilet has a fuzzy cover on it. 
Don't forget the huge basket of magazines from a million years ago that no one reads sitting by the toilet. Like my mom really thinks that her guests are going to sit in there and read a magazine.

And so much furniture! In my mom's living room alone, she has a huge giant built-in, a huge heavy long decorative table, three big glass end tables, another long decorative table, THREE wing back chairs, two big ottomans, a third tiny ottoman and a big coffee table and the couch. Plus The fireplace that has a huge shelf full of decorations and another huge shelf full of decorations. I'm not even sure how these shelves are still on the walls.

In our small guest room there's a queen bed, a nightstand on either side, a huge wicker chest, a huge wicker dresser, a huge filing cabinet that she has painted and decorated with fake flowers. Plus an accent table. There are three lamps in here for no reason. And 7 decorative pillows on the bed. 

I'm starting to pay attention to all the tchotchkes I'm finding and they are just so random.

Just some thoughts...do we not give previous generations enough credit?,"I'm not looking to excuse behavior or abuse from previous generations. I am merely here to propose a thought I had. 

I am just about 35 years old. I have 4 kids. I have/had a terrible relationship with my parents due to past abuse and trauma. 

I am neuro-spicy and have had a long time obsession with the 90's sitcom ""Roseanne"". 

I say these things as a preface only because it is relevant, mostly. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am re-watching the entire series of Roseanne for probably the millionth time and I get to season 5 episode 16 in which Roseanne's dad dies. For a little context there is mentions of abuse in the childhood of Roseanne and her sister by their fathers hand, he also was stepping out on their mom and ended up leaving her for the mistress. So, family abuse, generational trauma, etc. This was in the 90's mind you. 

So in the 90's the adults watching this would have been mostly boomers. Of course some Gen X and Millenials were, but the majority of ADULTS were boomers. 

This episode focuses on Roseanne and her struggle with dealing with her father's death and dealing with the after effects of the abuse she endured by his hand, physical and emotional/mental. She writes a letter to him that she reads as she stands, alone, next to his casket. During this emotional scene she talks about how angry she is for what he did and so on. 

It got me thinking. As a millenial I see a LOT of content centered around mental health, generational trauma, etc. I see so many amazing and awesome things where people from our generation are being a much more open and accepting place. Maybe sometimes we take it too far, but the fact that, as a whole, we are trying so hard to break these cycles is amazing! However, I don't think it started with us and we need to give some credit where it's due. 

Watching some of these old shows from the 80's/90's I'm noticing more and more how, maybe not all the time but at times, they had episodes that tackled things like family trauma and abuse. They brought it out into the open! Anyone else remember the episode of Boy Meets World where Corey helps the friend who's being abuse at home? That had to be written and directed by boomers or gen x. 

So, I guess what I'm ultimately getting at is this; we are making progress. It's slow, it's dirty, and sometimes a giant cesspool of just.....garbage, but it's progressing. In my own personal healing journey I learned that it gets very dark and dirty before it starts to get better, and I feel like maybe that's what's happening here. As a whole, humanity is working towards something better, but first we have to make it through the ick. 

Idk, maybe I'm just getting lost in the world of nostalgia by watching these old shows and contemplating life.",r/Millennials

I‚Äôm a 28yr old black woman who has been attending this church in midtown for a few years. I figured that it would be a cool way to meet people, get involved, etc. I really enjoy the sermons, music and the overall camaraderie since joining.

With that being said, I‚Äôm still a single woman, trying to date. Still currently on the dating apps, with no luck in sight. I‚Äôm aware that black women are already at a disadvantage in the dating world in Atlanta üòÖ. Even in church, I catch myself sometimes scoping around every now and then‚Ä¶but it seems that all the men there are already spoken for.

I just want to know if there are single men out there who actually do attend church. Maybe knowing that there is a portion of men who do go, will give me a sliver of hope to potentially meet a nice guy in this setting. 

Otherwise I‚Äôll just continue to enjoy the sermons alone and resort back to these apps ü´†

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Wow! Y‚Äôall really had quite a lot to say! For context, I definitely have a social life, and have no trouble going to gatherings and what not, when I can outside of my busy work schedule. 

With that being said, yes I‚Äôm single, I‚Äôm human. I‚Äôd like to find that special someone, so I have been actively searching. It‚Äôs just when I scan the room at church specifically, I notice the abundance of single women and lack of single men, hence the initial question. 

Based upon your answers, there are some extremely valid reasons as to why single men don‚Äôt attend anymore, which I can absolutely respect. I‚Äôve seen the recommendations and suggestions and will definitely take those into consideration as I continue my search.

"Millennials, technological advancement gives us reason for hope, not doom.","I know as millennials that doomerism is kind of our brand, but allow me to borrow a little bit of hopium from r/singularity for a minute.

  
First off, I want to assure you I'm not some Qanon conspiracy theorist. I have a bachelor's degree in Physics, I was an electrical engineer for 8 years, and I am currently a high school Physics teacher. That doesn't make me an authority on AI, but I think it does show that I have a healthy level of skepticism about bold claims.

Recently, AI technology has hit a critical point where advancements are happening quickly. ChatGPT only came out a little over a year ago. We went from most people believing AI would never be able to emulate human speech to an AI chatbot passing the bar exam with a better score than most lawyers in under a year... and ChatGPT is just the tip of the iceberg. Google solved a previously unsolved math problem using AI, researchers have automated chemistry research using GPT-4, and GitHub Co-pilot has gotten so good at writing code that some people think there will be no software engineers in 5 years.

The shock from ChatGPT has resulted in a huge capital investment in AI. Most of the possibilities of the technology *as it exists now* haven't even been realized yet, to say nothing of the possibility of an advanced artificial super intelligence (ASI) during our lifetimes. The hardware is coming along too; Boston Dynamics already has a humanoid robot that can carry boxes around. AI is going to  supercharge development of humanoid robots in the near future.

I know the gut instinct when we think about this stuff is to say, ""we're all just going to lose our jobs!"", and well, I agree in the short term a lot of people are going to lose their jobs. Artists and journalists will lose their jobs first, which really sucks, but eventually all of us are going to lose our jobs. What happens when AI and robots can do literally everything? I don't see how capitalism survives the shock. Artists, like the rest of us, will just have to sit at home and do whatever they want all day while collecting their UBI. Oh darn.

Of all of the crazy sci-fi ideas we've always seen in movies, ASI is the most likely to actually happen within our lifetimes. Maybe this doesn't improve things in 5 years, but think about what it will be like when you're retired. I think it's more likely than not that we will have anti-ageing drugs, ASI, and humanoid robots doing most labor by the time we reach retirement age. So, maybe it won't even matter that none of us have any retirement savings?

If you're like me and you've been hoping that something comes along and blows capitalism up, knocks us off our warmongering bullshit, and finally results in some reduced working hours I think this is it. There is some chance that it comes in the near future, and a dang good chance that it comes in our lifetimes. Shouldn't we be excited for it?

... and just to head it off, there is no reason to believe that AI will decide it needs to destroy all humans. Terminator and the Matrix are action movies, not documentaries, nor research papers. Most researchers in this area believe AI can be aligned with human needs.

I ask bc I've seen many posts lately on this sub in regard to working v rich parents/luck.


I acknowledge that we cannot control where or to who we are born too. But why does that bring up so much distain for ppl who were given things versus those who weren't? Why that let that sour your lives?


Personally started my first job at a dairy queen at 16 making 8.25 an hour.  I rode my bike to work many days of the week. 

It was great to pick up my biweekly paycheck of 500 dollars after tax and such. It just meant more taco bell and saving for a car.


At 16 and now In my late 20s I'd like to think I've worked for everything I have. I feel accomplished in what I've done in life so far..

I really contribute my success to working. Not even working hard but just having a job.


In college I worked ~32 hours between Friday afternoon and Sunday because I had class Monday through Friday. ( I still had the normal college experience of football games and socials as well)

I gained valuable work experience and graduated with no college debt.



I now manage a whole department in a smaller company doing actually very little work and more oversight. It's the easiest job ive ever had and the highest paying. I personally have no debts but have not purchased a house yet.

So I ask instead of being sour and jaded about things outside our control can we raise our kids to WORK not even work hard though. Work to get the things they want and to install an incentive to work to better themselves.

Thank you for readings.

Edit:

I'm getting many messages about how I am withholding info about privilege and graduating debt free.


To that I say I went to Iraq for six months paid for by Uncle Sam.  But overall it's still part of the overall theme of working. No one is too good to dig a ditch, work a cash register or run down a field through fire because those are means to having success in life.


Edit 2: 

I advocate for kids working so that kids have skills and experience outside of pleasures hobbies.

I am very jaded on this topic bc my father was never forced to grow up and still hasn't at 55 years old.

Let me explain. My grandfather owns a series of bars and diners. My dad is a ""manager"" at one of them but is just known for drinking all day and doing drugs with the employees. Outside of him being a division 1 baseball and playing 2 seasons of AA baseball he has not had a job. Ever! He does drugs and panhandles money. All he talks about is baseball, alcohol and speed ball.

"Fellow millennials, what was the first music album you bought with your own money?","I guess every generation thinks this, but I'm certain that we grew up in a rather interesting time for music. When I was 13 I spent some of my barmitzvah money on Fatboy Slim's ""You've Come a Long Way, Baby"" which was released in 1998 (I bought it in 1999). He was pretty big on MTV back then and that's how I grew to like his stuff, you probably know ""Right Here, Right Now"" or ""Right about now, the funk soul brother"". The album is perfection by the way, highly recommended.

"Retirement - what its purpose, why should we save, am I missing something?","Fellow Millennial here who works intensively with a variety of retirees and elders across the economic spectrum as they approach their final destination in life and I'm left with a few questions and needing perspective on the topic of 'Retirement', mainly what is its purpose and what is it really worth?

I have seen people who have saved, banked and paid into all the right financial and health policies Roths, IRAs, Trusts, LTC Insurance, etc only to have ""The House"" take back everything in time as they age through services over time.  

I think we all recognize that any amount of money we save or invest can be eaten up in several bites of medical events which most of us will experience as we age. People who had 1mil+ long term care policies, multiple homes, etc only for them to wind their way down their collected resources and end up in the same position as someone who had and did none of that. 

I've seen retirees who worked their whole life, save something, only to spend it down to get onto state Medicaid at 70; too wealthy for Medicaid, too poor to actually afford private services.  Then I've also worked with people who have never saved anything, worked their whole life and they wind up on Medicaid and they seem just as functioning as their wealthy counterpart, just less bitter than the wealthy.  The wealthy who watch their wealth decrease daily seem to have whiplash from waking from their dream of comfort and wealth as it all decreases they continue to age and recognize material comforts aren't stopping anything.

If ""The House"" is going to get everything anyway aren't we all just dragons building our hoards and in order to give it away piecemeal as we age?  It not like any group in particular has any perceptive advantage.  Like why run to build the biggest hoard if you're just going to give it away anyway and end up in the same place as someone who built nothing?

The wealthy who bought LTC policy use their benefit at the same hospital as everyone else which bills the same parent company who lobbies CMS for reimbursement rates on services, and the parent company owns both LTC insurer, the hospital group and the Independent Living or Assisted Living where the wealthy live; this is what I mean when I say ""The House"" gets it all back.

What are the arguments that retirement and the like outside of SSI are worthwhile?  Because when it comes to my direct experience working with our current elderly, it seems that no one gets a deal and those who bought all the fancy plans did a bunch of work for little material or physical gain.  Do we pay into IRAs, pensions and the like just to keep dreaming a little while longer?

I truly don't mean to come off pessimistic as I find life great, the world beautiful, I'm just looking to square the general ""financial advice"" towards retirement with my experience because may be I am missing something and not seeing why I would do any of it.

**EDIT** I didn't include what started me down this road, but it was this [Edward Jones - 40% forced into retirement due to health](https://www.edwardjones.com/us-en/why-edward-jones/news-media/press-releases/inflation-and-financial-assistance)

"Basics of Compound Growth and Investing for Millennials - HYSAs, IRAs and 401Ks","I‚Äôve been seeing quite a few posts in this sub about ‚Äúif I save $5K a year, I‚Äôll only have $50K in 10 years / $150K in 30 years.‚Äù With the implication of ‚Äúwhy bother??‚Äù

I can understand why Gen Zers may not understand compound growth and investing but with Millennials, it‚Äôs time to learn if you haven‚Äôt already.

Here‚Äôs are the basics: 

One of the safest way to invest currently is a High Yield Savings Account. These accounts are currently doing 5%. It costs a lot to borrow money  right now (see interest rates on home buying) but the flip side is you get more money for your savings.

If you invest 5K at 5%, it will be $62K at the end of 10 years. After 30, it will be $332K.

But if you are Millennial age, you should ideally be taking on some risk beyond savings accounts. 

Average market returns are 10% over the last 50 years. Adjusted to 8% for inflation, that would be 83K after 10 years and $616K after 30 at 5K a year. This also does not assume an increase in your contributions or any employer contributions from a 401K.

A common approach to this kind of savings is
1) Emergency fund
2) If you have a 401K offered AND they give you a match (free extra money), contribute as much as it takes to get all the free money. For example, if I contribute $6000 pretax dollars a year, my company gives me an extra free $3000. So that‚Äôs now $9000 to invest inside my 401K bucket. 

Because the money taken out before taxes, it feels like less than $250 out when it hits my paycheck twice a month. It feels more like $190 a paycheck. 

3) If you have 401K match and have contributed to it, then put any remaining money in a Roth IRA. It is after-tax but then grows tax-free. 

4) If you still have extra money after doing the Roth, go back to adding more to your 401K.

The Roth contribution limit is 7K in 2024.
The 401K personal contribution limit is 23K in 2024. (It can go much higher with employer contributions) 

I understand that many people didn‚Äôt learn this at school. But even if this was completely covered in a Financial Literacy class in the ‚Äò90s or early 2000s, you still need to stay on top of the changes. The numbers, rates and terms change each year. It is worth spending 1-2 hours a year reviewing options and changes. The initial set up of these accounts may take a few hours in Year 1 but after that, it requires very little maintenance. If you don‚Äôt want to get too into details, you can usually choose a plan with a name like ‚ÄúRetirement Year 2050.‚Äù (Insert the year you will be 68-72 here.)

Not everyone can save but if you can, you want to know your options. The last thing you want to do right now is save but have all your money make 0-1% in a traditional savings or checking account. It will in effect be going negative due to inflation.

And the younger you are, the more powerful your dollars are for their longterm growth potential. 

Good luck!",r/Millennials

So yeah it was a lot and all that cleaning after! I told her she can sit down, and my father in law and I would finish cleaning.

We both went to bed, barely had any energy to kiss. And cuddled each other to sleep. Today she woke up early morning to go to target. Because she likes to get the after Christmas deals. I was still in and out of sleep. But realized I didn‚Äôt have my cuddle buddy next to me.

I heard the car start up and she was leaving.
In my still sleepy state I texted her no kiss goodbye ü•∫? She came back, parked the car. Came in the house and she gave me a big kiss. She said she didn‚Äôt want to wake me up, because yesterday was a long day. And just wanted me to relax. 

I told her.. babe waking up to you is never a burden. She smiled kissed me again said I loved you. And off she went to the wonderful world of target.

While I dozed back to sleep in pure bliss. I can‚Äôt believe she came back. I love my wife. I do not deserve her. Just want to be a better man for her every second! ",r/Millennials

My boyfriend is upset. He's getting older and he feels people aren't trying as hard at Christmas.,"I just feel so upset for him. We just opened our christmas gifts this morning, and he got shower gels from pretty much everyone. He tried to not seem upset, but he did eventually start expressing how it made him feel. He feels that now he is a 33 year-old man, people in his life just aren't caring or wanting to try anymore to give him nice gifts this time of year. He really does not ask for much in life, he just always looks forward to Christmas. He puts in  a lot of effort for everyone elses' gifts, and it didn't look like he got the same in return. Even for his secret santa, someone got him golf-balls and he's never expressed any interest in golfing!

&amp;#x200B;

Do people just stop trying when it comes to getting meaningful gifts for the 30-year-old men in their lives? Do we just sound like spoilt brats right now? I really hope not lol. We are super chill, hardworking people so it isn't that we don't know how to be greatful or anything like that. When he told me he's afraid that the older he gets, the more he will just be forgotten, it devastated me.

How forgetful are you on a scale of 1-10? I think I‚Äôm at about an 8.,"
I feel like I am more forgetful than the average 37 year old. My ability to recall information quickly is awful. If someone asks me a question that requires to pull a memory from my brain (for example, a plot point from a movie I‚Äôve seen within the past year), I almost always need a reminder to help me remember. I‚Äôm really bad at remembering names, and sometimes I could be having a conversation with someone and then have no idea what we were talking about 5 minutes later.

"Given how common it is for many people in the millenial gen to struggle, doesn't it make sense for our generation to champion a modern version of a commune?","I've been looking at a lot of the content in this subreddit over the past couple of weeks, and from conversations I've had with friends and family it seems like there is a generalized sense of the loss of community. So many people are posting about being lonely, or lacking the support systems they need, etc.

Wouldn't it be sensible for a group of likeminded millenial folks to try to pool resources and start living a communal and less individualized lifestyle? I can see a lot of benefits to it. More financial security, the ability for those who want to have kids to be able to raise them and have a community available to support them (it takes a village), less loneliness, potentially a higher sense of purpose from being part of a community that is larger than oneself.

If you're one of the folks here that struggles with loneliness and is struggling to get by day to day, would you be down to live a communal lifestyle?

The compounding stress of life creates weird choices in younger folks in my opinion.,"EDIT:  thank you all for the vast majority of civil discourse.  I truly took away a lot of insight and perspectives!  I do have to go to bed now though.

There were a handful of people that really thought very poorly of me, and I‚Äôm sorry.  Please know that I never intended this post to be as popular as it is, but also never intended for it to offend anyone either.  It should be ok for people to want to try and understand things they don‚Äôt really understand.  That‚Äôs healthy.  That was my goal.

I‚Äôm an elder millennial at age 40.  I‚Äôve been a manager of front line employees since age 20 when I got my first promotion in to a management position.  I now own a small business and pay $25 an hour for some pretty easy work.

There‚Äôs some relative new phenomenon when the chips are down and life is stressful more people seem to just shut down and not be able to work.

I‚Äôve got a girl working for me that gave up $500 in work because she‚Äôs stressed out about a few things in her life.  None of the things she‚Äôs told me over the phone call warrant calling out if it were my life, but to each their own.  She literally says she can‚Äôt function because of the stress (some of the issues are even money related!)

I don‚Äôt really give life advice to younger folks anymore because I almost get the vibe they never want to hear it, but help me understand how a stressful situation doesn‚Äôt get exponentially more stressful when you stop making money?

I see it time and time again.  The easiest example I‚Äôve seen repeated over the years.

We are easily the luckiest generation to ever grace this earth. (So far),"Hear me out.

We have all the most advanced technology in the world at our fingertips. We enjoy access to information that could of only been dreamed of forty years ago, heck, most of human history. We can virtually learn anything we want and for free!

We get to enjoy this technology and all of the other thousands of advances coming when the older generations are long gone. We will be those old people that were born in the late 1900s. 

Our odds of decent life extension technology coming out in the next fifty years are really good compared to Gen X or Baby Boomers. It's not impossible that we could be the oldest generation around for a thousand years, or at least longer than anyone else in human history.

I wouldn't trade my coming of age experience with the average Boomer. Vietnam Draft? Lead poisoning? How about looking up things at the Library and ordering from catalogs? Extremely lethal car crashes? Second hand smoke everywhere? Nah. No thank you.

Is anyone else kind of over visiting parents for the holidays?,"This would be a novel if I actually let it all out and went into backstory so here goes my attempt at the long story short version. 

I 33f am the only non parent and non married human of my mom and stepdad‚Äôs 4 combined children. I am beyond happy with this, my relationships have all sucked, and I love children and work with them but it‚Äôs not for me. The American dream with a white picket fence and the mortgage, etc feels like propaganda to me, but I‚Äôm glad if it works for others. Just stop tying to push me, the heart shaped peg, into the square hole. Anyways‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

On the *surface* the holidays have been lovely. But I‚Äôm the only one of the kids that made it to my folks place for Christmas. And dear god has it been so very obvious that from their perspective I‚Äôm inadequate. 

One of them and one of their animals is currently recovering from surgery, so I went over there not only for Christmas, but to help out a bit. They are both so fucking stubborn. They won‚Äôt let anyone do anything, and they had the fucking nerve to complain that my grandpa (approaching 90) ‚Äúneeds help but won‚Äôt let any of us do it because if we try we are doing it wrong‚Äù ‚Ä¶.. I can‚Äôt even. All I could do was shrug, look at them sarcastically and say ‚Äúthat must be so frustrating to deal with‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt afford a ton of presents and they never make a list so I got them each like one thing I knew they wanted. My other gift to them was to cook dinner for Christmas. It was just the three of us so it was super chill so I wanted to handle it. I figured a roasted chicken, rice and Brussels would be perfect, so I told them, and went shopping for the ingredients. 

It was like herding cats just to figure out what they wanted for dinner and what time, so I just kind of called it based on the feedback and they agreed. I had gone outside for a quick phone call and a smoke that ran longer than expected, which I ended just before I needed to go inside to start dinner. I went inside to find my mom had just completely taken over. In the grand scheme of things it‚Äôs not a huge deal but it just hurt, like one of many of my lifetime of a death of a thousand cuts. It felt like she didn‚Äôt trust me to handle it. If they were ready they easily could have asked if I could come in soon or if I wanted help, we were eating at 5 ffs no one‚Äôs going to starve. I ‚Äôm a good cook, she knows it would be a nice meal. The reality is she is a control freak. She totally took over the chicken and micromanaged everything else I did. She told me how to cook the rice, how to saut√© veggies, how to cook the bacon, etc etc when I wasn‚Äôt doing anything wrong. 

I just don‚Äôt understand. Why is it so hard to let someone else have a turn? Why is it so hard to shut your fucking mouth about whether or not I cooked the bacon then cut it or cut it then cook it? She ended up ‚Äúletting me‚Äù cook the rice and veggies, but still looking peeved that she was stuck cooking. Like, sit down woman! You‚Äôre recovering from surgery and I‚Äôm here to help you, just let me cook one fucking meal without you needing to make everything about you. On top of it, literally like clockwork, anytime I was asked and had a chance to answer about me or my life, I was interrupted by either one of the sibs with their kids calling (not their fault and I honestly loved talking to them to) and I was completely forgotten. And of course, any time I have tried to calmly and kindly point out that x is happening and it hurts my feelings, I get read the riot act as if I‚Äôm being completely unreasonable for feeling forgotten when I‚Äôm literally forgotten, or ignored when I‚Äôm legitimately ignored etc. Holidays just feel like an Olympic level gaslighting event now, like I‚Äôm treated like I‚Äôm making everything in my experience up for attention.

"I really don‚Äôt like alcohol anymore, but I feel like I can‚Äôt have a robust social life without it. Especially with dating","Pretty much the title.

Soon to be 33 year old man, got the useless degree back in 2013, I‚Äôm now debt free, finally have a salaried job that I kinda like with benefits for a little over 50k. I love my hobbies (skiing and mountain biking) but they‚Äôre not the central part of my identity anymore. I stopped smoking weed. I take good care of my dog. I go to the gym 2-3 times a week. I feel like I‚Äôm making progress even if I‚Äôm behind a lot of my peers.

But I‚Äôm at the point where I just don‚Äôt like drinking at all anymore. 3 drinks and I‚Äôm gonna feel shitty in the morning, 5 drinks and the first half of the next day is ruined, even 1 or 2 and I feel like I‚Äôm struggling at the gym or exercising. I also just don‚Äôt enjoy the feeling of getting a buzz, and I hate feeling drunk, but I haven‚Äôt really gotten drunk in years. A glass of wine or something tasty with dinner is nice sometimes, but I really don‚Äôt do that much anymore either. Not to mention that a night out at a bar is offensively expensive. 

But I feel like that‚Äôs just how people socialize. Not everyone shares my hobbies, especially women, and those hobbies are not great ways to meet people. Sometimes I feel like I don‚Äôt know where to meet people or potential dates, then a friend will drag me to a bar and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúoh, that‚Äôs where everyone is.‚Äù 

Idk, I‚Äôm tired of flings and hookups (and even those don‚Äôt happen much anymore), I want to find someone to build a life with. I‚Äôve HATED dating apps and avoided them for years but maybe it‚Äôs time to try those again. I‚Äôm definitely not a ladies man but I do ok if I really push myself to go out and talk to girls, I just hate the environments where it‚Äôs appropriate to do that, partly because alcohol is almost always involved.

Is it just my parents or is this typical of their generation?,"My parents were born around 1960 and each attained a high school education. My mother didn‚Äôt work while raising kids and doesn‚Äôt work now and collects social security due to disability. My dad still full time in machining. They raised 3 kids, paid off their mortgage on their house, and have basically nothing in savings. With the mortgage paid off and little additional costs I am encouraging my dad to open a second 401k in addition to his employers and max out his contributions to both. I explained the difference between a ROTH and traditional and he glanced over it all and I quickly switched the topic.

Later on I broached the topic of how long my parents plan to stay in the house. I‚Äôm home only a few times a year and due to my mother‚Äôs declining abilities I‚Äôm realizing on this most recent trip basic cleaning has fallen by the wayside. I spent the last two days deep cleaning their 2 bathrooms. I inquired by asking if they planned on doing any work before they eventually sell the house ‚Äúway off in the future‚Äù.  They indicated that they didn‚Äôt plan on it. The house is rapidly decking; and it‚Äôs in an economically disadvantaged area with an aging septic system and bad well-water (it‚Äôs sulfuric and corroded the fixtures, smells bad, seems dangerous, no one drinks or cooks with it). 

Then the next day, after lots of conversation I sort of flat out asked them if they agree that it‚Äôs reasonable to say they anticipate their retirement to consist of the value of their house and social security and they basically said yes. I then asked them if they think that‚Äôs true of most of their generation and they said yes. And then I asked them what they think is going to happen as every one is selling their house to cash in for retirement and at the same time interest rates are high and rent is high and most millennials can‚Äôt afford to buy a house and they got real quiet. Everyone went to bed soon after and now I feel bad for bringing up such a dark side topic and in such a brute way, but my parents‚Äô Laissez-faire approach towards their last 30 years of life is terrifying. 

Does anyone else feel like their parents had it easy through life? They laughed at me and said it‚Äôs weird that I talk to my friends about interest rates and stuff. They seem so out of touch and like, it seems like their life was so easy. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre capable of handling the next 20 years nor are willing to start preparing now.

"American Millennials, how do you survive with so few paid-holidays?","I used to live in the United States from age 23-27 and got 10 paid-holidays every year. Then I moved to Europe (Holland/Netherlands), and got 25 paid-holidays in my first job (for 3 years), and 40 paid-holidays in my next job.

I was wondering, why don't American millennials demand more paid-holidays? If everyone does it, the corporations will have to yield. Also, everyone, from managers to workers, will be happy (who doesn't want to get paid for sitting at home, LOL!).

Paid vacation is absolutely essential for your mental health and overall well-being. Sure the Koreans and Japanese willingly surrender their lives for the sake of their employers. Where is that taking them, though? Those are some seriously depressed societies that no one should try to emulate. Maybe the Europeans overdo it (with hedonism), but 20-25 paid holidays, government mandated, has to be the norm, IMHO.

Why does it seems like our gen has the worst family presence?,"Title says it all.

My family is so difunctional and it is very large too.

I haven't spoken to my mother in almost 10 years now. She is an addict, I won't say recovered or recovering because no matter how much she may say she is, I can guarantee she isn't because she has lied about it several times in the past.

My father was the parent that was the constant in my life. I lived with my mother until I was 6, when she was really deep into her addiction. My father took me in and with the help of my grandparents, his parents, I was able to get to and from school and have a life. After a couple years, he met my stepmother on an online chat group in the AOL heydays. When she was around or we were around her, I was happy, until they got married and he moved us to live with her in her home state.

I was struggling with the move. We moved a couple states away, about 6 hours from family. It was hard. I wasn't the best in school for this and I only had one friend at the time. She said some remarks about my learning abilities or lack thereof in a very mean spirited kind of way. Instead of sticking up for me, he moved me back to my home state to live with my aunt for a few years. Things were much better then. I was able to see family again, I made a bunch of new friends, I was just happier.

I used to spend summer with him and my stepmom while living with my aunt. In the summer between 7th and 8th grade, he decided to move me back in with him again. He told me this as we were about halfway there on our way down. This started a series of declining events that lead to me despising my stepmother and the start of having a bad relationship with him that continued/continues more than a decade after moving out after graduating.

Because of knowing she was the reason why I had to move back home from my dads earlier, I never wanted anything to do with her. She would get on my nerves in the easiest way and I would rebuke pretty easily. This led to me being grounded by her for quite some time, a little over two years. Everytime I was getting close to being ungrounded, she would say or do something that would trigger me and I would have a week or two added continuously. My father never stepped in.

During this time, I joined alot of after school activities to just try having him acknowledge me. I joined the chorus group, was in plays and joined the swim team. He only ever came to one swim meet but left before I was even up. He didn't even come to the final competition where I got a bronze medal. 

He now has 2 more kids with her. One born while I was a freshman and the other was born less than a month before I graduated high school, which he didn't even attend either. I even gave up my room so that they each could have their own. I moved out less than a month later and moved back to my home state a couple months after that. I can count on maybe two hands the number of times I have seen him or my brothers since I moved out 13 almost 14 years later.",r/Millennials
I hate how Millenials are shamed for spending money (if/when they have some),"""People are not struggling - look at the masses buying stuff - everyone is doing great - its their own fault if they dont save for a house/car"".

I hate how people and mostly Millenials are shamed for spending money on ""useless things"" and not saving on a house or car and then being blamed for not being able to afford the big stuff.

When a house and/car is out of reach of course people will buy the small stuff they want/makes them happy. Like if I lived like a monk I could perhaps save 4000 Dollars in a year. Thats means even after 40 years I would only have 160 000 Dollars which is nowhere near enough to buy a house. So why not spend it? Why not use the money now before inflation destroys my purchasing power even further.

Shame on me and other Millenials that we dont earn enough to buy a house - like ever - and shame on us for spending it now while money still has more purchasing power than in 10 years and shame on us for actually buying a few things that make us happy even when they are ""useless"".

Do you feel you have to pretend to be a perfect parent? I think it's different today than in the past.,"I think a real difference between parenting today and parenting when I was a child is that there is a lot less pressure on parents, particularly moms,  to pretend to be perfect. Maybe it's because of social media and ""#mommyjuice"" posts, particularly Facebook. Maybe it has something to do with living through the ""failure to launch"" years and cynicism is expected. Maybe it was watching 90's TV sitcoms with struggling parents normalized not being perfect in our minds. Either way, I feel like it's okay for parents today to not pretend to be perfect whereas our parents always had to pretend they were, which caused a lot of gaslighting that their problems were their kids' fault. I certainly talk to my kids differently than my parents talked to me in this regard.

And, plot twist, I think our kids are generally pretty understanding of us not being perfect all the time.

Sick of working 9 to 5. I am Retiring at 50. I need your opinion,"Last night, having a few drinks, I felt low knowing I had to work on Christmas. Been on this strict diet, no junk food or beer, feeling good at first. But then, I realized I'm just using food and drinks to ignore the fact that work is consuming my life. I work all week, too tired to enjoy weekends.

Got me thinking, how long will this continue? Waiting till I'm 65 to live seems wrong. I've decided to quit at 50, no matter my finances. I want to enjoy life while I'm still healthy. Seeing many 65-year-olds struggling with health and bills, I refuse to be part of that. So, I'm breaking free from this system.
I checked a life expectancy website, and it said the best scenario for me might be around 75, although it may not be accurate. But I'm not concerned about living beyond that age. I don't want to be too old to manage simple things like going to the bathroom or eating independently. I crave a life of freedom, to live on my terms, work when I choose, and travel without relying on a boss's permission.

So, I've made a decision to start living freely at 50. I might still work occasionally for some extra cash, but my focus will shift to family, friends, and my mental health. Currently, I feel like I'm not really living. Nine hours of work, nine hours of sleep, and a two-hour commute leave me with only four hours a day for basic necessities like eating, showering, and working out. It's time for a change.",r/Millennials
Ideas on potential places to move - 39/m currently in a small Midwest city,"Hi all, just looking for some input and inspiration here. I'm in a small college town in Appalachia that I've lived in for 15 years total.. was going to move pre pandemic but 2020 almost collapsed my business so I stayed to rebuild it with the low cost of living here. 

My business can be run fully remote.

I know I'd do better somewhere that has more to offer but having a hard time getting excited about a move. I do have some friends and a small community here. Single and the dating pool for a 39/m is not great. Closest big city is columbus Ohio and over 1 hr away.

Family and friends has mostly all moved from Ohio and my parents, best friend, brother and cousin are in AZ/NM, Utah, and SF. I've just never really felt drawn to the west although I enjoyed visiting there. But have heard good things about NM. Even if I wanted to live in CA I doubt I could afford it as I put most of what I make back into my business.

I've previously lived in West Palm Beach FL for 3 years (wouldn't go back) and have traveled quite a bit sometimes for months on end. Spent time in NY, other parts of Florida, CA, and all surrounding states to Ohio. Also spent months in south America and Europe (mostly Spain).

I've thought about the Spain digital nomad visa as moving there is probably my first choice but obviously not as practical.

For a practical move I've thought of Columbus, northeastern Ohio, Raleigh NC, or St Pete FL (my favorite city in FL).

About me -

-Into fitness/outdoors
-Kayak fishing/fishing in general
-Prefer being in smaller cities close to big metro areas vs downtown in a huge city
-Like the arts and restaurants but don't have time for much of either
-Not a fan of Ohios climate but can tolerate winters if I can get out and travel for a bit

Most of my time now is spent working on my business or working out. I'd like to still find somewhere with a decent cost of living and maybe a better climate. 

As you can tell I'm feeling a bit directionless as far as potential destinations and would like to hear from anyone who loves where they live. As ultimately that's what I'm going for.

Thanks in advance ~!",r/Millennials

Are younger generations starting to realize the negative effect of cell phones?,"I am a young millennial (born 1993) so I remember the days we‚Äôd all connect and share the same experiences at family gatherings. Even though we would still just watch TV or play video games, everyone was present and focused on the same screen. 

Then, iPhones came out and as we know, gen Z became addicted to their private, personal pocket screens. Now of course all generations are addicted and it is bizarre seeing my boomer parents glued to their phones the same exact way they‚Äôd always complained others were. 

But this Christmas I noticed my younger cousins taking breaks from their phones more frequently. My youngest cousin who used to always be locked in with headphones on has now transitioned to reading his kindle which I think is much more stimulating than YouTube. My other, older cousins (still gen z) would be on their phones for a bit but then put them away to do anything else whether it‚Äôs watch TV, try and join the adults conversations, or just take a nap. 

I‚Äôve always known these phones were detrimental to society because they made us feel connected to strangers or non-present friends while disconnecting us from the people and experiences around us in reality. The worsening of this effect makes me very depressed but maybe there is hope! I feel like seeing our parents‚Äô personalities and attitudes change now that they are addicted to Facebook has made us realize we are not headed to a happy future and we do need to live in the present more. 

But maybe that‚Äôs just my family. What has your experiences been this year during Christmas?",r/Millennials

Why do people still buy themed knick knacks for Christmas gifts?

PSA, do not ever admit to anyone you know that you think a possibly collectible category of item is cute. I thought collectible themed knick knacks were mainly a boomer thing. It seems I was wrong.  A couple years ago I started purchasing some gnomes, just a few, for my flower beds.  I thought 5 or 6 of them would be cute.  This year for Christmas, out of 20 gifts from assorted family and friends, I received 9 gnome knick knacks, mainly from Gen X relatives funny enough.  I'm not a knick knack person, I specifically tell people if they ask what get me, ""nothing I have to dust, useful or edible is even better"".  This is the second Christmas like this in a row.  I'm starting to feel like I'm trapped in a  bad remake of David the Gnome, in my own home, lol.  How on earth do I make it stop without seeming rude or ungrateful?  Side note, half of the knick knacks are Christmas decor, which means I only have to look at them a few weeks of the year.

Not all of our parents generation was evil. There was good ones also.,"I grew up in a very broken home. For the first 11 years of my life.

How to stop getting Christmas gifts? Am I just a terrible person?,"First off, Merry Christmas.

I'm a single 36M. I work fully remote and have very little in terms of obligations outside of my mortgage which is actually pretty affordable since I got lucky with interest rates. My jobs have no schedule and let me work 24/7 as much or as little as I want whenever I want (I only get paid for working).

I do pretty well and pretty much buy myself whatever I want (which is mostly world travel along with some random things I collect which are really difficult for anyone else to purchase).

Based on all of this, I am extremely hard to shop for and usually end up with random junk I don't want or gift cards/cash which, while nice in theory, make me feel guilty because my family thinks it's important to spend lots of money on me since I'm the only member of my household. My family is not very well off so I really don't want them spending money on me when it seems so pointless.

It's even more frustrating because I try to create lists of things I need but can't be bothered to buy but don't end up getting them. This year I asked my mom for a very basic assortment of items - deodorant, toothpaste, table salt (I tried cooking a while back and somehow I don't have any salt), and a wallet. Outside of the wallet these items are so basic it's more of a hassle to buy them than anything and while I guess I could get them on Amazon, this doesn't really make sense. I'm very particular on the wallet and explained to my mom exactly what I want - a black leather trifold wallet embossed with the logo of one of the sports teams I support (she supports the same teams so this seemed doable).

Today I got a whole bunch of stuff that realistically I can't/won't ever use; a set of salt and pepper shakers (but no salt);  3 wallets; and none of the other items I mentioned. This was especially frustrating as none of the wallets matched the description I gave and none can be returned because my name is embossed on all of them. My mom also gave me a pretty good-sized check to buy what I want but this makes me feel sick. My mom is always stressed about money (she's retired and on a pension) and the check is in an amount that's quite substantial for her, but pretty insignificant for me. 

My sister also tried really hard. I collect signed photos of players from the teams I cheer for and hang them on my wall. I am extremely selective about these and all of them are certified by third party authentication services. My sister (with the help of her husband) bought me a photo which is not authenticated and is of a player I already have. My mom told me this cost her over $100. I have no use for this since I already have this item and I can't even try to sell this because the lack of authentication makes it close to worthless. I could get it authenticated but that would cost $50 and even if it turns out real I could only get about $150 for the item before eBay fees 

How can I get people to stop doing this? I'm happy to get together and buy my nieces gifts because they enjoy receiving them and they're little kids. Seeing people waste their hard earned money on things that realistically I want to throw away makes me feel bad. It's also a bit hurtful because even though I don't really want anything, I gave a list of really easy to get items and got none of them.

TL/DR: How to I tell my family to stop buying me gifts?",r/Millennials

I've found that when they choose to even do something like this to begin with I just don't trust them at all with anything really. If you're the type to do things like this there's not much stopping you from doing it later on even after you have ""real"" feelings for someone.

I want to take up running and swimming, which both sound reasonable. I also want to ""try"" to take up Muay Thai. I have no expectations, and I fully recognize that I might just be too old to ""start"" this. I bought a longboard back in 2020 during the pandemic but had a falling out with the friend that was teaching me at the beginning of 21, so that ended up being a decoration in the corner of the bedroom. I would like to give this another go (after some serious weightloss), but again, we run into the ""might be too old for this"" problem. Now for some fun questions.

\#1 Is losing weight and getting healthy too boring for a mid-life crisis? (this is a humor-based question)  
\#2 Is it a reasonable goal to drop from 280 to 150 ***BEFORE*** the end of 2024?  
\#3 Is it reasonable to take up running, swimming, Muay Thai, and skating in the same year?  
\#4 Do you think 40 ""too old"" for Muay Thai and skating? If yes, please explain, and thank you.  
\#5 To those who are almost 40 and in their 40's, what are you doing to stay active and healthy?  
\#6 I had Covid in November 2021, and it almost ended me. I have been sickly for 2 years. My mother died in my arms at the age of 58 from cardiac arrest after having lost her breath. I am not ending like that. I can't say what changed as this year is ending, but anyway.

Did Anyone Play Toejam and Earl? Sega Genesis circa 1997ish?,"I was just telling my daughter how my only sibling was 10 years older and I didn't have anyone to help me when I got stuck on a video game. Then I let her know that we couldn't even save our games, and it took days to beat Sonic so you'd have to pause it for long periods and hope it didn't freeze. Then I remembered Toejam &amp; Earl. My boomer dad and his gf thought it would be a good idea to get me and his gf's daughter a joint Christmas present, which was a used Sega Genesis with a bunch of games, most of the games were like ""meh"". We lived in separate households so I'm sure you can imagine how the jointly owned game console thing worked out. 

Sometimes I come across someone who used to play Toejam and Earl, but I don't get a whole lot of people who were familiar with it. It was my first game that was like ""mission"" based, like it kinda had a storyline I guess? I actually don't fully remember the point of the game.",r/Millennials

"To respond to the ""not all millennial are fucked"" post, let me tell you about a conversation I had with my uncle","I love my uncle, but he's been pretty wealthy for a pretty long time. He thought I was being dramatic when I said how bad things were right now and how I longed for a past where one income could buy a house and support a family. 

We did some math. My grandpa bought his first house in 1973 for about 20K. We looked up the median income and found in 1973 my grandpa would have paid 2x the median income for his house. Despite me making well over today's median income, I'm looking to pay roughly 4x my income for a house. My uncle doesn't doubt me anymore. 

Some of you Millenials were lucky enough to buy houses 5+ years ago when things weren't completely fucked. Well, things right now are completely fucked. And it's 100% a systemic issue. 

For those who are lucky enough to be doing well right now, please look outside of your current situation and realize people need help. And please vote for people who honestly want to change things.

Rant over.

Edit: spelling 

Edit: For all the people asking, I'm looking at a 2-3 bedroom house in a decent neighborhood. I'm not looking for anything fancy. Pretty much exactly what my grandpa bought in 1973. Also he bought a 1500 sq foot house for everyone who's asking

Well to do Millennials - do you feel pressure from your friends &amp; family this holiday season?,"I know not everyone is as well off as we are (independently wealthy DINKs for context), but do you feel any pressure around this time of year from your friends and family?

I sure do. Particularly my family (not hers, they‚Äôre already well off for the most part). They expect me to buy and pay for things they wouldn‚Äôt ever put on each other, and routinely ask for things that cost hundreds even thousands of dollars for their families and without so much as even acknowledging anything I‚Äôve done in the mean time to help.

I get the rest of my family isn‚Äôt as well off, and I‚Äôve always been charitable to them in many ways, like when my brother was going through rehab and I paid for his kids to attend camps and their after school programs, I buy out the Girl Scout cookies every year and other things (majority for their children) to help.

Every holiday though I get requests for things like for instance, my brother is hounding me for a new iPhone and iPad claiming it‚Äôs for his kids, but I know they just got new electronics this year for their birthdays.

My own mom wants me to get her a ‚Äúonce in a lifetime‚Äù package to Hawaii .

When I was little we had a family tradition of going out to eat but everyone paid there own way, now my family pressures me to pay for everyone *and* wants to go to a high end restaurant.

My uncles somehow got it in their head that I owe them a vehicle that I sold aftermarket and are mad I didn‚Äôt give it to one of them instead.

I love my family, mostly, but they‚Äôve become extremely toxic about my success and it‚Äôs only gotten worse.

Does anyone else deal with this kind of stuff? How do you do it? Honestly if it wasn‚Äôt for the kids I wouldn‚Äôt put up with any of it (and truthfully I only out in with half of it as it is, I don‚Äôt give in to every demand)",r/Millennials

To the Non-American Millennials - Are you also on the fence about children or considering being childfree?,"Recently, I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about why I‚Äôm leaning towards not having kids. At first, it had a lot to do with generational trauma but now that I‚Äôve worked through that I still have concerns. 

The winters are so mild and the last couple of summers have been absolutely unbearable. Making enough to live off of is getting increasingly harder. Even if I do manage to raise a well adjusted child, what will the people around them be like considering people are less social in general these days. 

But then I thought to myself, are my feelings just exacerbated because I‚Äôm in America and these things may be more prevalent here than other parts of the world? Would I consider having kids if I lived in a different country?

So non American millennials, what are y‚Äôall thinking about the choice to have children?",r/Millennials

Algorithmically-driven content is getting pretty absurd. Talk to me about whether you think social media sites will go the way of cable news as a result? What do you think?,"I'm just noticing that on *any* site I visit, I'm getting pushed all this shit (corporate advertising, ""influencer"" stuff, low-quality ""sponsored"" memes, ""nostalgia bait,"" racist junk, etc.) which has no correlation with what I usually like to consume. This applies to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, all of these kinds of sites.

Increasingly it's been taking up an inordinate amount of space in my feeds. I'm wondering if people feel the same way and if they think it will 1) lead longtime social media users to stop logging on, and 2) if the lack of engaging/appealing content will lead newer generations away from social media due to a lack of interest.

Does anyone else care less and less about being socially well-adjusted as you grow older?,"I asked ChatGPT (to take with a grain of salt), and it said the following:

The concern about being socially well-adjusted, especially prominent during teenage years, is rooted in several psychological and social factors:

1. **Belonging and Acceptance:** Humans are social beings with a fundamental need for belonging and acceptance. Being socially well-adjusted is often equated with being accepted by peers, which is crucial for emotional well-being, especially in adolescence.

2. **Social Learning:** During the formative years, individuals learn social norms and behaviors. Conforming to these norms can be seen as a way to ensure social success and acceptance.

3. **Identity Formation:** Adolescence and young adulthood are key periods for identity development. Fitting in with a social group can provide a sense of identity and self-worth.

4. **Peer Influence:** Teenagers are particularly susceptible to peer influence. The desire to fit in and be well-adjusted often stems from wanting to align with the expectations and behaviors of peers.

5. **Fear of Rejection:** The fear of being ostracized or rejected by a social group can drive the need to be socially well-adjusted. This fear tends to be stronger in younger years.

6. **Social and Cultural Expectations:** Societal and cultural norms often dictate what being 'well-adjusted' looks like, influencing how individuals behave in social contexts.

As people grow older, several changes contribute to a decreased emphasis on being socially well-adjusted:

- **Increased Self-Confidence:** Age often brings greater confidence in one‚Äôs own values and decisions, reducing the need for external validation.
- **Shift in Priorities:** With maturity, priorities often shift from social acceptance to personal fulfillment, family, career, and other personal interests.
- **Greater Self-Knowledge:** Older individuals generally have a clearer understanding of themselves, leading to a focus on authenticity over conformity.
- **Reduced Peer Pressure:** As the social dynamics of school and early adulthood fade, there's less pressure to conform to a peer group‚Äôs norms.

In summary, the importance placed on being socially well-adjusted varies with age, influenced by psychological needs, social dynamics, personal growth, and changing life priorities. The shift towards valuing individuality and personal satisfaction over social conformity is a common part of aging and personal development.

Hope for my fellow millennials. Why are titles required to be 60 Characters??,"I hate to see my fellow millennials feeling so hopeless. I feel lucky I have found financial success relatively and I was able to follow my passion. I want to do whatever I can to try and help.

1.) For housing there are places all over the world called intentional communities where people form group homes to help ease the cost of living, to give yourself some kind of support network.

2.) I found financial success when I joined a union. I do live in a very expensive city but, the pay for my gig was between 40-50$ per hour. I was able to work OT and I would be getting paid double time. I was able to save and invest.(Send me a DM and I can offer more guidance).

3.) I bought land 5 acres and I will be starting my own community as a way to help + give back.

My hope for the future
The science of climate change is still developing, the scientific community is still coming to an understanding of the word around us and how it all works. CO2 is sequestered through the process of weathering. Rocks/minerals are dissolved by the rain. They wash into the ocean changing the ph. I‚Äôve been reading about how basalt rock formations are great at helping sequester CO2. Basalt comes from volcanos so we are in no short supply of this material. I bring this up because I am going to stay positive for a better future. 

There is new research looking in aerosols created by trees that help form rain clouds and help cool the earth. These aerosols are called sesquiterpenes. 

After learning about sesquiterpenes I have started planting more trees in my area. I am only 1 person but together we can help restore nature to hopefully heal this planet.

I know this is not a lot but please do your best to stay positive. The human will is more powerful than you might think. I see a lot of people around here who use very strong language it does affect your life, it does diminish the possibility of finding your happiness. I know things may feel glum but together we need to make these changes. It is better than no action at all it will feel better to do the right thing, together we will accomplish our dreams and take care of each other.

How do you deal with conflict stemming from parents lack of self-awareness?,"37F. My parents are both in their 70s. Only around age 30 have I really come into my own and have firm and healthy boundaries and self-respect. I did not have a good model when I was a child. Now that I have all of these in place, I struggle very much with my boomer parents. My mom and I have never had a good relationship and I cut her out completely this year after she invalidated me for the last time. Long story short, she tricked me out of a large sum of money, and refuses to acknowledge the situation, or that it was wrong, or pay me back. So now I‚Äôm down to one parent and he has no respect for my boundaries at all. He showed up without notice yesterday and turned my plans upside down. This is a common theme for him to not give me any notice despite me asking and come and go as he pleases. He lives eight hours away. We went to a party last night and he suddenly wanted to leave then yelled at me, saying I was driving too fast, and I needed to be careful since I‚Äôve had so many car accidents when I‚Äôve had none. I missed more than half of the party party and was so sad. Now he left and I have no idea where he‚Äôs at and I refuse to have a shitty Christmas because of his bad attitude. there won‚Äôt be an apology.  Obviously it‚Äôs not just this situation but I really struggle with having this type of behavior in my life at all, and it seems like the only solution is to never see him again which isn‚Äôt feasible either. I would never tolerate anything like this from another person.  How do you deal with parents that continually disrespect your boundaries and treat you like you‚Äôre still a child and they‚Äôre your parent? It seems like the only solution is to never see them again, which isn‚Äôt really feasible either. I‚Äôm tired of feeling guilty and sad and disappointed.",r/Millennials

The cost of the ceremony/rings, figuring out the invite list, yada yada yada. We just don‚Äôt care. We want to spend that money on travel and house upgrades.

How many of you have chosen to remain childfree and does your family care?,"Seems like with a wrecked economy and never quite receiving our ‚Äúmoment under the sun‚Äù when life would become easier, having children is no longer affordable or beneficial. Moreover, we are probably the first generation empowered enough to collectively realize that we do not have to have children if we do not want to. So how many of you have chosen to remain childfree and does your family care? Many parents still expect to be grandparents someday.

I knew from the time that I was 12 I never wanted to have my own children. I was the oldest child growing up and had to take care of my younger siblings, moreover, we came from a very dysfunctional household with an addict father, and I never wanted to have to sacrifice my freedom and happiness again. I had my vasectomy about a year and a half ago, one of the best decisions of my life. My mother is supportive, despite being abusive and narcissistic, my father ironically was more upset about it, presumably because of his traditional or religious expectations of what life is supposed to be like.

I have no desire to reproduce. Whatever paternal feelings I have could be fulfilled by serving as a stepfather or adopting the child of my partner if I married a single mother. I‚Äôd rather be a father for another child than bring my own into the world.",r/Millennials

Aging doesn‚Äôt have to be this terrible irreversible process if you choose to still have fun,"Everyone here is doom and gloom about our 30s being around the corner and perhaps our 40s for some of us. But it doesn‚Äôt have to be this terrible irreversible process. I mean, aside from Botox, there‚Äôs nothing much we can do about our physical appearances besides maintaining our health so that we hopefully age better, I concede this point. But there‚Äôs no rule book which says that we have to be boring or that we cannot still go out like we used to when we were younger. Moreover, there‚Äôs no reason we cannot still socialize with or even date younger people, regardless of whether society laughs at us, so long as we do not do anything unethical or illegal obviously. If anything, we probably have more money now that we can actually do more of the fun things that we could not do when we were younger, afford the nicer outfits, buy the tickets etc.

Granted, I‚Äôm almost 28 and feel like the past 5 years snuck up on me too quickly. I never consented to no longer being in my early 20s, but I‚Äôve probably made more of an effort in my late 20s to socialize, visit nightclubs, and go out more than I ever did when I was younger due to crippling social anxiety. Aging is just a state of mind. Choose to have fun.

How festive is your personal Festivus? The one you have without the rest of us?,"I (33F) and my spouse (34M) aren't traveling to see family, don't live near any relatives, and don't have children.

Holidays like this we get to pick and choose how cheerily we celebrate, and its interesting to see what traditions or new ideas we end up doing and what typical expectations get the boot immediately.

We still hang stockings and put up a tree, wrap presents, bake too many desserts and find time to watch a few classic movies, but many of both of our sides of the family's long-held traditions are traded in because we don't care for them, at least not enough to put in effort on our own.

Are millennials not letting their kids spend the night at friends houses anymore? Is that not a thing?,"I've noticed a trend in parenting that has moved away from kids having more independent time from their parents and this has caused some strain on friendships between those with kids and those without. Lately there's been lots of discussion here about how millennials don't really use babysitters much anymore, and the cost is pointed at for being the biggest reason. But this leaves me wondering why babysitting is the only thing talked about in this case. 

I understand not everyone lives close to family that can watch the kids while they go have an adult hangout, but what happened to kids spending the night at friends houses? It used to be a thing that when kids made friends in school, they would spend the night at each others houses and that would serve as a great opportunity for parents to get their adult time. I guess it reminds me a lot of the ""it takes a village"" conversations that have happened here, and how this concept of sleepovers was essentially an element of that village mentality. It's not a rising cost issue, so what is it?",r/Millennials

They come home and pile stuff up everywhere and they‚Äôll just leave it there because there‚Äôs literally no room for it. There‚Äôs no more room but they keep buying. 

I tried explaining to my mom that it is impossible to keep this place clean when there‚Äôs too many things and not enough places for them to go. Her solution just shove it in and make room. 

She had blankets and coats from decades stacked in a utility closet and had her vacuum at the end of the hallway and her broom sitting by the door in the garage. (And don‚Äôt get me started on the garage, full to the brim, can barely walk through FULL) 

We got bins, stored away the blankets and jackets and finally used the closet as it‚Äôs intended, lasted maybe a month and it‚Äôs filling back up with junk.

Does our generation deal with abuse/sa differently? Are we better than our parents when it comes to abuse?,"I'm 33. My parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents and all the adults in my childhood let me repeatedly be around dangerous, predatory people. 

My dad was a r*pist, who abused multiple people in our own family, including me. He showed up at the airport when my grandparents we supposed to come get me, took off with me, and nobody knew where I was for over a week, and nobody called the police. 

Over the course of Christmas, I was abused &amp; then dropped off. Again, nobody called the cops. 

I was forbidden to see my dad for about 4 years, until I was 15, then after that I was pressured to forgive my father and make up with him to ""save our relationship"". They then forced me to be alone with him numerous times. 

There were other incidents of dangerous predatorrs being around kids in the family &amp; everyone acted like it was normal 

I no longer speak to most of the family. 

*The thing that blows me away is how common a story like this is in our generation. Adults just left us alone &amp; around dangerous, untrustworthy people.*

There was a tendency to rug sweep &amp; minimize the abuse. **The idea that we were told to cover up around the creepy uncle instead of the creep uncle being kicked out of family get togethers!**

Do your young kids get still get invited to birthday parties?,My son used to get invited to birthday parties all the time until COVID hit after he turned four.

Adulthood is lonely and maybe we weren‚Äôt prepared for it like other generations,"Water, water, everywhere and not a drop to drink. Nobody prepares you for how lonely adulthood is. Truth be told, I feel like previous generations depending on the opportunities and whether you were in city vs. country, you kind of anticipated what your social circles would become after high school and even as you got a job or went to college, etc. But with the onset of social media that entered our orbit for our generation, I feel it gave a different illusion and as we got older it became a nightmare where people become more competitive and less engaged with having a relationship with old friends. I dunno. Apart from the obvious (marriage/kids/moving away/etc), it just seems like adulthood is organically lonely and I think people should be better prepared for it before they leave high school.

How do you plan to educate your kids (or future kids)? Do local schools impact your choice of home?,"We are moving for my spouse‚Äôs job and are finally pulling the trigger on buying a house. We are both prior military and have moved so much in our early adult lives that I‚Äôm excited so finally buy a place we can stay in for hopefully a long time. 

We are moving to a large city in Florida. Our realtor basically described it as ‚Äúyou can have a good sized lot and bad schools, or you can have good schools and a smaller lot.‚Äù Also homes in the area with better schools will appreciate more. All this makes sense I guess.

I grew up in a small Midwest town where there were no private schools and our public schools were just fine. We got a good education, people got into good colleges, school was safe, etc. There were some people who homeschooled, but it was a small group and they were very religious and socially awkward tbh. 

I‚Äôm trying to decide how much weight to put on the schools as we look to buy a home. I‚Äôve never really thought much about it, but as I do, I don‚Äôt know that I want my kids in Florida public schools at all.

How are that many millennials in such crippling student loan debt?,"You can read the whole post but I‚Äôll make my questions short here:

-Are a majority of people our age really in crippling debt, or am I just seeing a disproportionate amount of grievances online that don‚Äôt reflect the true state of us.
-If you are in a lot of debt, how much is it and why is it so high? Was it because you went out of state, didn‚Äôt have scholarships or was it because other expenses got in the way of paying it back?

I see and hear a lot of grievances about the current state of student loans and the resulting debt. I just saw an article about how millions of borrowers are defaulting on their loans because they cannot and won‚Äôt pay them because they owe such astronomical amounts that it‚Äôs not even worth trying. The article went on to say that student loan debt has completely barred so many folks from owning homes because their credit is now shot. All the comments were in agreement that this was definitely true for them and for everyone around them. 

Now I may be speaking from a place of privilege, but I don‚Äôt see that reflected in my life or in the life of any of my peers. For context I graduated high school a bit over 10 years ago. I went to my state college for undergrad and once I was established in my field for a few years I got my masters from the same university with the help of my employer (I paid 65% and my employer gave me a stipend for the rest). My husband is about 5 years older than I and got his bachelor‚Äôs and masters the same way. We met while in college. I lived at home throughout and he lived with some roommates. My parents didn‚Äôt charge rent but it was expected that I take care of my own tuition, my share of groceries and my transportation, so I worked weekends at a restaurant and paid my way through school. I wasn‚Äôt a brainiac by any means but I did get a few small scholarships that helped at least pay for books. I never had to take out a single loan, and neither did my husband, because we were comfortable with just paying off tuition and bills with  the money we were making at our part time jobs. When taking to my coworkers and friends our age, most people have the same story as us‚Äîstate university, part time job while in school, and no need for student loans. 

What I don‚Äôt understand is how are people, especially millennials in my age group (late 20s, early 30s) in such crippling student loan debt? If you went out of state, I can maybe see 10-15k, but I keep hearing people say that they are 50, 100, 150k + in debt from just an undergraduate degree.",r/Millennials

It seems like Millennials are the peak of internet literacy because of when we were born.,"There's something that I've noticed and wanted to see if other people have the same experience.  Basically it seems that Millennials, as a group, are the only generation that can use the internet effectively.  Boomers are obviously pretty bad at the internet, and Gen X are a little better but not much.  Since we (millennials) lived through the rise of the internet and personal computers while we were growing up, it seems like we have a better understanding of how it works including the benefits and the hazards of the internet.  I worked at a college for a few years and the Gen Z kids coming through had no idea how to use a computer or the internet for anything besides social media.  They can't turn in assignments online, do research online, read the syllabus online, or use any actual professional program including anything from the microsoft office suite.  They act completely internet illiterate and seem to have similar gullibility issues that the older generations have with navigating the internet.  And they also need their hands held with everything.  I have friends that work at other colleges and they say the same thing.

Do any other Millennials relate to having extremely young parents?,"I never understood the concept of Millennials having Baby Boomer parents since mine had me in high school. Both of my parents belong to Generation X, my grandparents belong to the Silent Generation. Yet some Millennials even describe having grandparents that were in World War II. That was my great grandpa I barely knew, who died when I was 10 or 11.

Having younger parents was terrible, I would have rather had older boomer parents like my friends. The problem was that younger parents were smarter about censoring access to music, media, and youth culture, it was harder to fool them or keep them in the dark. I just wanted to listen to ringtone rap and text message my friends, they sheltered me from everything because of the cultural rot of the 1990s that they didn‚Äôt want me to be exposed to, like Doggystyle even though they got to listen to it etc.

Meanwhile, my friends with boomer parents had full access to everything including the early internet. Their only complaint was that they could not go out or do anything with their friends. My parents didn‚Äôt care about that aspect, but otherwise censored all of my access to popular youth culture, even CW.

I think the upsurge in helicopter parenting around the 1990s-early 2000s came from younger Gen X parents compensating for their own latchkey neglectful upbringings. My dad the hypocritical addict always told me to be grateful since his parents didn‚Äôt care or censor his media.",r/Millennials

Do you guys still handwrite? Not sure if this is a generation thing.,"Was thinking and also was kind of inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/16g4y76/whats_one_skill_youre_grateful_for_knowinghaving/).  


When trying to learn something, a system or a concept or a game or what have you, taking notes about it on a laptop is not great for me.   


I think it is because I'll write down a lot of information and if I put it in Notepad or Word, the info is in a window that I have to put down to look at something else, and if I am trying to build knowledge about something and reference notes at the same time, it's too much trouble to be going back and forth in between windows or browser tabs or what have you. It takes away from being able to focus on the information.   


There's also a bit of a mental communication ""middleman"" between the brain and the fingers when typing and I'm trying to remember what I'm saying and look for the correct keys on the keyboard at the same time. I can type fast and naturally but that issue is still there somewhat.  


Handwriting the information is easier and more fluid. There's a direct mind-to-paper feel there and I can focus on what I'm trying to express. Also, the information is constantly there on paper right next to me and I can go to other sites and windows on the laptop and easily reference and add notes. The bigger picture of what I'm studying becomes easier to see and learn, as well as the details.  


I think the paper being consistently present and easily reference-able is key. That is also why, when working somewhere, I wish they would still have analog clocks on walls. I like to be able to simply dart my eyes somewhere and see the information easily, not have to look for my phone and press the screen. Clock could be digital, but still, should be on a physical thing I can see elsewhere.

Sudden 20 year reunion causing anxiety and panic. Is this a mid-life crisis?,"I unexpectedly met a school mate from 20 years ago, yesterday, and I have been reeling, since. Background: we met in school and were good friends. I was close to his gf at the time as well. After I left school (he was my junior by 2 years), we got in touch almost 5-7 (?) years later, over Facebook. We have sporadically texted over social media since then (NY or birthdays). I never expected to see him again (school was in a different country than our home country and we're currently living in 2 different countries on the same continent), and definitely not through work. We were both very shocked but caught up over lunch about our current lives. However, I feel like I have been unable to process this development. 

I'm not the kind of person who has ever worried about growing older. I don't regret the past or lament over it. But right now, there is this distinct feeling of loss. Obviously triggered since I saw him and I don't really know how to deal with it. There's such a difference between life then and life now and it's hard to reconcile both. My memories are from when I was 16/17 yo and since yesterday I am in flashback mode. Remembering school and friends and life in general, back then. Is this nostalgia? Or does it sound like I'm having my first ""mid-life"" crisis?

Things have improved now so it‚Äôs just like any other place, but the 90s looked like the 80s for example when it came to interior design and technology, and the 2000s looked like the 90s. Sometimes I‚Äôm not sure if my nostalgic memories are millennial or just‚Ä¶ rural.

Out of curiosity and a hope that I got to have a generally normal childhood, I have to ask, how many of you grew up with:

- rotary dial landlines

- bars in the finished basement of every family home (with stools, mirrored glass shelving, the works)

- that weird orange/cream/brown/sometimes mustard yellow colour palette that saturated every rug, couch, curtain, or other fabric within reach

- learning both cursive and computer typing in the same grade 

- wooden jungle gyms that gave you splinters and metal slides that were probably way too high for how shallow the sides were

- reading a lot of suspiciously survival-themed novels for assigned reading in school (the cay, the hatchet, my side of the mountain, holes, etc)

- doing school sleepovers in the gym as a ‚Äúfun thing‚Äù, including parent volunteers chaperoning and making pancakes

How's your health? Does everyone else feel completely run down all the time?,"When's the last time you woke up feeling like you actually got sleep, woke up energized and refreshed? Idk if it's just an age thing but I haven't felt like sleep did me any good since before I had kids. 

When's the last time you felt good, painless, energetic, carefree?

I take meds that are supposed to help but I never feel like I get sleep which makes my anxiety and depression so much worse. I'm always tired and just never feel good. Never have motivation for anything because everything just zaps my energy, it just feels like so much effort for just day to day living. Something on me alway hurts whether it's a migraine, knee pain, just feeling constantly run down, my stomach hurts and everything I eat, even just plain rice, has me in the bathroom constantly. I do have PCOS and I had my gall bladder removed 2020, at that time they told me I had hashimotto's thyroiditis but no one ever said anything about what to do about it. They didn't give me meds for it. So I wonder if I even have this issue or if it's just something everyone just deals with? 

I'm only 28, my husband who's 31 never feels bad and almost never hurts. I just feel so miserable all the time. Is this just part of being old? I'm not even that old so I just can't imagine dealing with this for the next 35 years.",r/Millennials

Why Prices of everything is Rising While Quality seems to be sucking,"I had this discussion with a really good and smart friend, this convo blew his mind, maybe it'll help others too. (BTW this is just one of the reasons, obvio it's complicated)

American economy is driven by entrepreneurship. In America, there seem to be two types of entrepreneurs:

1. Innovators - Those who find ways to produce better products more efficiently and pass cost savings to consumers. Amazon is a prime example, enabling free 2-day shipping through process innovations that took a decade of sacrificing profit.


2. Opportunists - Those who exploit the tax code and cheap financing to buy out essential goods and services and charge the maximum prices the market can bear. Methods include utilizing data analytics to optimize pricing (like RealPage's rental pricing algorithms), ""flipping"" undervalued assets like houses, and consolidating ownership of resources like gas stations to reduce competition and everything around you. Examples listed below

a) RealPage's software used an algorithm to churn through big data, each night to determine the max rent for their clients properties. (Same thing happening in the airbnb ecosystem)

b) All the real estate hustler - who would buy a fixer upper home, put a fresh coat of paint and dump it into the market.

c) When I was living in Florida, I saw this multiple companies, come in an buy all the gas stations and storage facilities in a neighborhood, bascially make few upgrades and jack up the prices...

In my book it's okay to get rich as long as you provide lot of value to your customers and they love your service, aka Amazon. So it's funny we fight against the ""billionaires"" when it's actually the ""millionaires"" who....

I think american culture makes too many ""short term Opportunists"" type entrepreneur.

What Mister Rogers might have told us now - unexpected convo btw Millennial and Silent Generation,"I work in sales. I got a very nice gentleman on the phone who is 83 years old -- Silent Generation.

What he does is pretty cool: photo restoration; e.g., fixing and colorizing a weathered photo of a grandfather in his WWII soldier uniform. I thought about how our generation stores memories vs previous generations. I'll bet most of us 'digital natives' have loads of photos and videos in Facebook and iCloud - my wife and I do. Meanwhile we have boxes and boxes of my mother-in-law's old family photos in storage.

The more we talked, the more he had to say. 

He said the worst letters of the alphabet are A, B, C, D, and F. Too many young people's joy and peace depend on their performance in life. Many feel we are ""not good enough,"" to the point of despair and suicide. But this man wants us to know our value doesn't come from what we do.

I got warm and fuzzy Mister Rogers vibes (""I like you just the way you are""). Mister Rogers said 'I give an expression of care every day to each child' ([https://current.org/1969/05/i-give-an-expression-of-care-every-day-to-each-child/](https://current.org/1969/05/i-give-an-expression-of-care-every-day-to-each-child/)) and I still get teary eyed when I hear him say those things. Knowing I matter and I'm important, no matter what - that always meant a lot to me.

So here's where I wondered what Mister Rogers would say to us now.

The gentleman on the phone says this when he meets a young woman who isn't wearing a ring. First, he says, remember there is not a single person on the planet like you. You are totally unique person - your interests, feelings, talents, thoughts, down to your DNA - one of a kind and special. So don't feel like you need to perform, do things, or act a certain way for the attention of men. It's backwards now - men don't elevate to impress and woo women anymore, but women lower their standards so men will want them. (That's oversimplifying probably).

Anyway, what do you think? 

1. Do you think this gentleman is right?
2. What do you think Mister Rogers would say to us now?

How seriously were concussions taken while you were growing up?,"It wasn't until about 2011 that head injuries were given much thought at my school. I'm pretty sure that was the first year that my sports teams started doing concussion baseline screenings prior to the first practice. I was a sophomore in high school at that point and had already (likely) racked up several concussions throughout my childhood. Between hockey and football, ""getting your bell rung"" was treated pretty casually by most of the coaches, officials, parents, etc. 

I distinctly remember being a freshman on the sidelines and watching one of my senior teammates having no clue where/who he was after taking a particularly brutal hit on the field. He had blood coming from his ear (just like Billy Bob) and his helmet had even cracked! Since he and I were the only two players wearing that particular style of helmet, I had to turn mine in after the game and got one of the new ones they ordered after the incident. The whole tone around head injuries changed completely after that. 

Was my school/area behind the times in addressing this? When did you take your first baseline? Was there an ""incident"" that changed everyone's approach? Do you wish concussions had been taken more seriously when you were younger? I'm curious to know.

Exploring 2000s Fashion: Nostalgia and Personal Style Journey,"hello millenials of the reddit community,

i hope you're all doing well! im writing this post as i wanted to dive into a topic that's been on my mind lately ‚Äì the fashion of the 2000s. as a female born in the 2000s, my own journey with fashion has been quite difficult. growing up, I didn't experience much of the 2000s teenage wear firsthand, as I was just a baby. and when my primary school years finally kicked off in the 2010s, the shift towards different trends began.

so as i gew up, i found myself drawn to the style choices of my aunties on my dad's side. their fashion, characterized by basic jeans, layered tops, and jackets, was something i quite. it wasn't the overly dramatic 2000s wear that some millenials seem to hate, but rather a more subdued approach that i find rather aesthetically pleasing. don't get me wrong i love theto be honest im not too sure what im talking about here when i say ""overly dramatic"" because i do like the ""frazzled english woman"" look or the jeans tucked in their fav pair of uggs or boots with a cute belt and layered tanks with a v neck sweater ontop and a jacket along with a scarf and newsboy hat for the winter as well.

but what im trying to say is forward to today, as we witness a resurgence of 2000s fashion people have added their modern twist. making it hard to find pieces I truly love, especially when going op shopping or to the ""2000s secondhand shops"" or the online apps that are overly expensive. it seems like I often settle for items out of necessity rather than genuine preference, like going ""i can't find anything and this seems ok so ill just grab this because i havent found anything else"". and when living in a country with limited options in op shops, coupled with my mother leaving her 90s and 2000s clothing in Europe when she moved around 2004, it has also added an extra layer of challenge to my quest for the perfect wardrobe.

so, after the long un-needed explanation as to why im writing this post i come to ask the questions:

1. what were the iconic fashion trends for girls in the 2000s?
2. which brands were considered the rave during that era?

i'm particularly interested in hearing about the fashion landscape of the 2000s and any insights into the evolution of styles post that era. your personal experiences, favorite brands, and even recommendations for finding authentic 2000s-inspired pieces would be greatly appreciated.   
P,S. i have found that reddit does not allow people to post worded posts along with a few images attached so i have put a link to a pinterest board that i found through tiktok (no hate to them) that kind of incorporates what i like..

Millenial Parents Look Like Forlorn Veterans this Holiday Season,"If I can do math, most parents during 2020 were millenials.

We who are weighed down by children (who are also nature's joy in a very meaningful way), are watching the other generations rebound from COVID like it never happened.

Sure, everyone's dating life took a severe nosedive.  But the severe lack of support millenial parents failed to receive in 2020/2021, kind of got us stuck.  No one is coming to rescue us, we'll be fine, but the isolation from COVID and the dual-sided extremism (from foreign sources, botfarms, etc.), has made us a guinea pig generation in how chaos can undermine productivity and wherewithal of a key demographic group.

What things from our generation do you not like or consider shameful?,"I‚Äôm a young Millennial born in 1996, so I have a foot in both doors between Millennials and Generation Z, and there are a few things that I dislike from our generation.

The only difference is that they wanted to live in the city, have iPhones when they were a status symbol, and boast about their surface level political knowledge while posting pictures of food on social media. Hipsters were the ultimate millennial boomer hypocrites, and because of them, there is some degree of truth to the snobby ‚Äúavocado toast‚Äù stereotype.

This mentality continued into the younger cohort of Millennials like myself because we judged people tremendously on whether or not they went to college and disregarded all tradespeople as unintelligent or shameful.

Meanwhile, Generation Z has completely abandoned the boomer mentality that wealth is the true measure of success, and seems a lot more willing to follow their beliefs even when it makes them uncomfortable or has real life implications, like student walkouts and campus strikes. Millennials only liked to be political when it did not compromise their comfort in the city.

Do you still send and /or recieve Christmas cards in the mail?,"I just finished addressing Christmas cards for this year. We did a photo card with my two kids, my youngest is only 1 mo old. As I was going thru my address list, I realized I was only really mailing cards to older relatives and longtime friends-- most of whom send me a card each year. 

If I think about it: my family only receives about 8 cards a year and we send about 25 out. 

Do people our age do traditional Christmas cards anymore? Who are you sending them to? Do you receive many from people our age? 

Really... should I just plan on only sending out 10 cards next year to my old relatives who seem to reciprocate?",r/Millennials

9/11 ended Pokemania for Children and younger teens I believe,"Pokemania was a wild and amazing time in North America between 1998 and 2001. Pokemon crystal released in July 2001 after GS, Y, and RB released every year, and the next games wouldn't release until March 17 2003.

Summer 2001 was the summer I transitioned from elementary school to junior high. When we did a tour of the junior high building in summer 2001 the art classroom was full of wonder. Lugias, Charizards, Pikachus, and so many others. These were works from the previous grade 7 class who had just finished and were now in grade 8. It was obvious that being in junior high didn't hinder their love for pokemon. They didn't think it was uncool, they reveled in it's glory full stop.

9/11 happened a week or two into my grade 7's start, and it was just a long winded (on the news stations) and depressing event that it just deflated things for everyone. It made things a little too real, even for me in Canada. Flights became brutal and general trust levels dropped. After that pokemon was taboo in junior high. Kids would say to grow up and that it was for babies. Anyone in grade 9 playing ruby and sapphire on school grounds was bullied for it.

It wasn't until we transitioned to high school in 2004 where pokemon made a full recovery. Then everyone played pokemon at lunch again and nobody got bullied. But junior high was this weird fascist anti pokemon mentality. Pokemania was a joyous and magical event but it couldn't be sustained after 9/11. Even the grade 8's who had shown such love for pokemon in their art were part of the bullying.

My guess? Everyone pretended to hate pokemon but still played it at home. That's what I did. XD But yeah, yugioh became the nerdy game of choice in junior high.",r/Millennials

"As I am approaching 30, I am realizing how far behind my peers I am.","I am a young millennial who will be turning 30 next year. From ages 18-24 I experienced several traumatic life events that culminated in some serious mental health and addiction issues, in addition to making me a very young widow. 

Because of this, I never got to go to college past my first semester and didn‚Äôt really have the luxury of thinking ahead in my career or my finances because I was just trying to survive. I worked in restaurants and finally established a career path for myself, but it was basically eliminated during Covid when I was 27 so it was back to square one. 

I was finally able to do some schooling and secure a part time position in my field, but it‚Äôs rough out here right now. I am married to a wonderful man and we have two cats, a cute little apartment and are in the early stages of our real careers. 

I can‚Äôt help but feel so behind though. A high school friend has a birthday today so I clicked on her Facebook profile to wish her happy birthday, and saw that she‚Äôs the Vice President of a bank. Everyone seems to be buying houses, having babies, working these jobs that really intimidate me. 

I guess I‚Äôm just looking for reassurance that this isn‚Äôt just me, that someone else out there is trying to do the right things and still just feels like they can‚Äôt keep up. I lost so much of my youth to drugs and grief, and my therapist is always trying to flip my mindset that overcoming those things is a big deal. But I feel like my peers just look at me and see a fatter, uglier version of myself that didn‚Äôt live up to my potential like they did.",r/Millennials

Is anyone else grossed out with our youth culture obsession yet?,"I mean, my header says it all. Now that I'm 35 have a couple kids my perspectives and opinions have morphed quite a bit with regards to our media culture. 

I find myself looking at what my fellow millenials say on tiktok and insta really upsetting. There is this chronic complaint of getting old (something obviously not exclusive to our generation) which as a generation that takes pride in breaking generational curses seems really out of touch to me. Why do you care what an 18 year old highschool kid or some college freshman thinks about your style as an adult? It seems like since the invention of the teenager In The 70s (as a marketable group, don't come for me saying teenagers have always existed, duh) we seem to value what young people think more than adults. It even plays out in how some parents have taken gentle parenting and just become permissive parents letting the kids run the show. 

As the new adults in the room it would be great to see more of us actively reject what the media and kids think is ""shading us"" and just accept and even revel in our age and all the wisdom and experience it has afforded us; instead it seems like a good portion of us are actively trying to ""stay young"" and buy into the psy-op that we need to buy into the new trends so we don't ""grow old"".

Anyone else hitting career hurdles where the BS is too much stress to chase?,"39 y/o checking in, wondering if I'm alone in my attitude or what.  I feel like I've hit a wall, or a hurdle really, that I can't muster the energy to jump over.  It's not that the activity is hard.  I don't see the value or the point.

My job has a in-house qualification program where I have to carry around a checklist and ask various staff members about their jobs or related topics and collect their signature. (It's probably 60 pages.  The pdf just keeps scrolling.) Then I show the completed form to my boss and schedule a board with my boss's peers.  (the boss doesn't go to the board)  There I get asked questions on job tasks and general leadership and management.  Some of them are the hokey, ""What is your leadership philosophy?""

At the end of this internal qualification I get.... nothing.  My record is updated and I'm told that the next round of promotions will go better for me by having the updated record.  No new jobs or assignments (wouldn't even dream of more pay).  

Everyone says the process is no big deal.  I've had friends offer to sign my entire worksheet, saying I've worked there long enough and this tool is just to slow down people who aren't liked or to screen out people who don't care.  But maybe I'm in that second group?  (possibly the first group too since my boss has stated we'll do this by the book:  all signatures first, then board.)

I'm just kind of done with it.  I've dodged similar hassles before without penalty (that I know of), and this is either the biggest or just the latest.  Most of my peers look to have grinded out the packet or some have told me their boss said ""go ahead"" and the board was just the old people telling management horror stories.

Is anyone else here more nostalgic for the 2010s than the 00s?,"I was born in 1989, so I feel I am possibly a bit of an outlier here due to my life circumstances, but between the 90s, 00s, and 2010s, the 2010s might actually be the time period I am most nostalgic for. While I had a great 90s childhood, the 00s were rough for me. I still have nostalgia for entertainment and pop culture of that time, but as a lived experience, I feel a lot less nostalgia. 

The 2010s, however, were  huge for me. I reinvented myself in university, becoming almost a completely different person and having a great few years. I then graduated and spent a lot of the 2010s working abroad, traveling, and more. I am unfortunately paying the price now for that in that my retirement account could definitely use more than a little bit of a boost...but for making memories and personal growth, it couldn't be beat. 

Whenever I go browse 2010s music nostalgia playlists on Youtube or other such videos, the vast, vast majority of the comments are from Gen Zers. I feel like, as a Millennial, I'm very much an outlier in this regard - which is interesting, as the 2010s were at the time regarded as a very Millennial decade (heck, the term itself gained mainstream currency, we were ""Gen Y"" in the 00s).

Experiences we had in the 90's that kids today will not have,"I'm being a bit nostalgic tonight...

I was a pre-teen in the early 90's, late teens at the end of the 90's. In the early 90's, the weekends were a blast. After school all my friends and I would get together, go to the arcade, ride around town on our bikes and in the evening would go to the video rental store and rent a bunch of movies and stock up up as much junk food as we could.

There would be about 5 or so of us sleeping over at my house, we'd play Nintendo, play hide and seek, do stupid stuff such as the Oujia Board and ""light as a feather, stiff as a board"". We'd have sleeping bags and be spread out in my parents living room and we'd watch the movies we rented while eating our junk food. We usually stayed up until 3/4am watching movies and passing out whenever.

When I was in high school in the late 90's, parties were lit. A friend and fellow classmate's family owned a bunch of land out in the country, and we'd find someone to buy us crap tons of alcohol and we'd all meet up and have a bonfire, music and just have an awesome time. Nobody had cellphones back then, we just enjoyed the moment. So many times many of us would just pass out drunk in the field lol...

I'm not sure kids today do any of that, or will have the experiences that we had in the 90's.

"Excuse the interruption, just a general question to the US millennials.","No, this is not an ""angry man shouting at clouds"" rant, this is something entirely different.  

I am a Gen X guy.  My father (last surviving parent) died at the beginning of COVID.  A  couple weeks ago, I got the final box of things my Dad (and Mom) kept for me.  In it was a bunch of letters I wrote back and forth to them about my experiences in the Army, and more specifically, my time in the Balkans Conflict during the early days (1995-1996) while I was in Sarajevo. 

During that time a number of kids across the country wrote letters to ""Any Service Member"".  I still have 4-5 cards that I replied too.  Obviously, times, experiences, age gaps, and such made any truly meaningful letter writing exceptionally difficult.  It might surprise a number of you to know that those letters were appreciated.  I was going through a really rough time (divorce while deployed).  Today, with the internet, I could probably look these ""kids"" up (your generation) to send a much more meaningful thank you letter. 

Today, I am now in a much better place.  I remarried, had kids, my youngest in graduating college this year, and I retired from the Army. 

Question.  If I wrote them a letter, would that come off creepy?  Would you be weirded out?  Not looking to meet in person, or talk on the phone, just a letter seeing how they are after nearly 28 years.

Let me know what you think.

**Edited to add**: Since this blew up--I am sending some emails.  If you used to live in Potosi / Mineral Point MO area check your inboxes!

**Edit#2**:  Found one of the ""kids"" on FB.  We are exchanging messages right now.  He has a daughter and we are sharing stories about how fun kids are.  I am pretty sure I found one other ""kid"" too, but I will send off a written letter.  ""Kid"" #3 has a fairly common hispanic name and lived in Texas; not likely to be able to find him.

Has anyone found it odd how American society is structured to make having children a nuisance? Has it always been like this?,"Let's break down the ""American dream"" right now. 

Grade school years, children are simply out of the question. I can still recall my divorced parents both telling me to not get any girls pregnant. At age 18 you are expected to be either in college or living on your own. If you have a child then you are supposed to be able to provide for them, God forbid asking your family for help then too. 

By age 24, you are supposed to be done with college, swimming in debt btw, and be engaged to your sweetheart from highschool or college. After a few years of getting yourself situated in your new high paying job, by age 28 you should be looking to have children. This also means either one person stays home with the children or you make enough to afford a sitter/daycare. I'm assuming most people don't want to have children in their 40's so that leaves a window of 10 years. 

...

It sounds feasible but as we know, life isn't that simple. Many people want to travel, relationships end early, people get fired, small businesses go down, etc. Also not everyone is going to get a high paying job, if you don't this process gets so much tougher. If everything did workout who wouldnt enjoy life for a bit without any obligations.

Ive known people who started businesses, and have them crash and in their 30's they had to start over. On top of everything else, with child support, men specifically are fearful of having kids. A few of my friends and a bunch of my coworkers had a child or two in a relationship that didn't work out. I'm not going to go into detail but those child support stories almost made me eyes pop out of my skull. I mean it sounded like a litteral horror story.

Do older millennials remember an over-protection surge among parents during the 90s?,"I am 31 (1992), my boyfriend is 40 (1983).

He was raised with the parenting mentality of ""get out and dont come home until the streetlights come on."" 

My own parents never took their eyes off me.  Ever.  Playing outside, roller skates, bicycles, everything was monitored outside of the house.

I asked my boyfriend if he remembered when parents suddenly became SO super-protective during the 90s.  If it was some kind of movement. 
  
I will provide that I was home-schooled in my upbringing but I have met SO many other people by now that I no longer believe home-school is the only cause.  He said that his own mother became ridiculously protective over his youngest sibling who was born 1999.

I am wondering what the difference is about.  I'm wondering if there was some prolific kidnapping that frightened 90s parents.. the murder of JonBenet Ramsey, perhaps?  I don't know.

Does anybody have any idea what this is about???  Or maybe it is just a Texas thing????  Is this real?  Or am I just dreaming?

The weird realization that a generation of people will be gone soon,"So the greatest generation (1901-1927), also known as the ww2 generation, will be mostly gone in the next 10 years. As of 2023, there are around *100,000 people in the US belonging to that cohort.

It's wild to think that this group had people who made some of the greatest contributions to science, lived through the great depression, were sent to the front lines to fight the nazis, and gave birth to the generation that we now know as the silents and baby boomers.

It's a little sad to me that this generation will be gone soon. These people are living history books!

Beauty industry tip culture + inflation vent. With price increases are you still tipping the same and as often? How are you affording the same services?,"37F And like everyone else in the world right now, I‚Äôm experiencing sticker shock when I even step out of the  house. Wondering how I make more than I ever have before but feel so poor. I was lucky and negotiated a significant raise for myself this year, but nowhere touches the cost of inflation.  Hair used to cost $250 now it‚Äôs $400. Nails used to cost $75 now it‚Äôs $115. I‚Äôm in a big city, so my prices may be higher, but it‚Äôs not like I can go somewhere else cheaper so YMMV on prices. 

Now literally everywhere has a tip screen, even when you go to get Botox or Fillers, even though the price is already marked up on the product exponentially, now you‚Äôre expected to tip on top of that? It‚Äôs wild to me. So not only is the cost of the product or service now 30-50% more or higher, you‚Äôre supposed to tip 15-20% on top of that too? I feel like the beauty industry is claiming prices have gone up, so their prices are going up too, which is true to some degree, but I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs reflective. Like grocery stores are making profits right now, but blaming it on inflation, when it‚Äôs really just greed because people have to have groceries and they know people will pay it. I honestly don‚Äôt understand how anyone is affording any of these services anymore. I‚Äôve stopped getting everything for this reason except for Hair because I can‚Äôt do that myself. I even taught myself Botox to save money for goodness sakes. Nails too. It‚Äôs a very frustrating feeling to get to what I thought was going to be my dream salary yet I feel like I can‚Äôt afford the cost-of-living and not once in the history of the past 40 years have prices gone back down after inflation. So we‚Äôre just stuck with this it seems. 


I feel like tipping originally it was based off restaurant workers who got paid a very low hourly wage and had to have the tips to make a livable wage. Not sure who decided that customers, instead of employers should be paying their workers, but I digress. Nail and hair salons dictate their own price that is already a livable wage so tips on top of that isn‚Äôt the same. The last time I went to get my hair done she was making over $250 an hour then when I checked out, they charged me a credit card fee and verbally asked me what tip I wanted to leave, which was very off putting. Am I wrong for not wanting to tip on an already greatly increased price? 

 I have always tipped and will continue to do so in the restaurant and service industry, but this has gotten to be too much. I am not a cheap person, but I also don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs my responsibility to spend an additional 15- 20% on top of an already very very expensive service. I clearly should‚Äôve gone into a different industry instead of spending tens of thousands of dollars getting my masters in healthcare.  I have decided from now on I‚Äôm going to ask the price of services before hand and just bring them cash in that amount. That way they won‚Äôt have to pay taxes on the money and the additional that would‚Äôve gone to taxes or credit card fees they can keep. Win-win.

And I already know some troll is going to say ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt afford to tip, then you shouldn‚Äôt be having the service‚Äù, the whole premise is not about that. I wish we could just make the price the price I wish we could just make the price the price, like Europe does, and not have all these expectations for tipping.

Stole this post from r/decadeology. What do you predict the latter half of the 2020's will bring?,"I predict makeup and fashion will be a lot more toned down.

The 2010's and early 2020's seemed to be all about excess in fashion. Nail styles are currently super long talons with intricate colors and styles. I predict nails will start getting shorter and more natural looking. Less gemstoned talons, more trimmed natural nails with a nude or sheer polish or classic reds and pinks.

Makeup is already shifting from the heavy drag-inspired look of 2016 to clean girl makeup or the no-makeup makeup look. I predict this trend will continue. People will favor skincare routines and more toned down makeup rather than cakeing makeup on to look like an entirely different person. Similar to the shift of heavy rashy looking blushes and bright blue eyeshadow of the 80' to Kate Moss' clean barefaced waifish look of the 90's. 

Fashion will favor coverage more. Crop tops and shirts with cutouts will slowly disappear. As will the 90's grunge aesthetic. We're going on at least 10 years of a 90's grunge revival now in the 2020's. It's growing stale. The anti-90's grunge look and anti-athleisure look will probably lean more preppy. The pendulum will swing for pants as well. Instead of ass-accentuating leggings or skinny jeans, we will see looser fits. Athleisure and skinny jeans will be what middle aged moms wear. Looser fitting low rise jeans will be what the young people wear. I'm sorry guys, but low rise jeans will be back with a vengeance. It's just the natural shift from the current high waisted pants. Pants can't get any higher than they are now. The only way left to go is down.

Sadly, I predict the ideal body shape will start to shift from the current BBL Kardashian shape to a more slim, less curvy look. B or C cups for breasts, flat stomach, and smaller asses. Again, think of the shift from the curvy athletic models of the 80's to the waifes of the 90's. I think everyone will be burned out on BBL's and large fake boobs, so a smaller body type will be seen as a breath of fresh air. Body positivity will be out of style. Eating disorders will be the new edgy crisis every girl will struggle with.

While fashion and makeup will become more toned down, the beige/ nude Instagram aesthetic for home decor will flip to maximalism. Think Sabrina Spellman's bedroom from the 90's Sabrina The Teenage Witch. No more beige or white, we will be seeing a lot more color and clutter in trendy modern homes. 

Music is due for a rock revival. Rap and pop is growing stale. In the next few years, we will have a rock artist or band that will emerge from out of nowhere and change the current musical landscape. 

In some ways, I think people will become less tolerant. I think this will be the edgy anti-woke culture. Probably not for sexuality or mental health, as that will see more tolerance and acceptance. But the way that millennials prioritize kindness and acceptance, I think it will become trendy and edgy among young people to be anti-woke. ""Let people like things"" will be replaced with "" either conform or suffer from constant bullying."" I only say this because I feel like I've already been seeing it more and more on social media. People just aren't as nice as they used to be in the 2010's/pre pandemic. I have been seeing a lot more comments tearing people down with a bunch of replies in agreement instead of positive comments or comments defending someone from bullies.

Feel like Teaching English Abroad for 6 years has Ruined any Chance of Making a Life in America,"I'm 33 (M) and I started teaching English in Eastern Asia in 2017. I've worked in China, Japan and Korea, and the last time I was in America was for two months in 2019. At that time I was totally happy with my life living abroad and, after immediately regretting leaving, secured a job and was back right away.  
But now I really regret this. It was in the middle of this year, after about 9 months of just total unhappiness and doing nothing at all, sleeping in every weekend and dreading *leaving* work because the only thing I enjoyed was working with the kids who are goofy and always fun and once I went home I had no idea what to do, that I realized I've completely done nothing for the past six years other than reach an age where I can't drink without massive hangovers following, have fostered no skill development whatsoever, and that all the things which I admired about living in East Asia, namely the provided apartment, meeting people from around the world, and absent drinking laws, no longer mean anything to me.  
I like working with kids and am surprisingly good at it, but I haven't learned anything else since starting this. All these random buxibans/eikaiwa/hagwons don't mean squat on my resume, I think I have *less* skills domestically now than when I left because I don't even remember how to do basic things in America, and I feel like I've totally decimated any chance I maybe could have had creating a life in America for myself.  
For the record, I graduated in 2016 with a BA in English Literature (3.9gpa). At the time I thought it would get me into some sort of position involving writing or editing, but after an entire year of sending out applications and *still* not even being offered a rejection letter and just outright ignored, I decided to go abroad (which I actually really *didn't* want to do and post-poned as much I could, because I had studied abroad in Japan and absolutely *hated* it). I really felt betrayed by the promise of college, which I had always just presumed true and actually loved studying Literature and had an incredibly rich time in college with just reading and arguing and doing all that fun snobby stuff concerning and was so excited to stay within that circle with the ambiguous career to follow, because it really changed nothing in my life save give me massive debt once I'd finished--- a debt which I've never paid a single dollar toward to, mostly because teaching abroad can be chaotic at times and it's easy to be wiped out from whatever couple of grand you've saved.  
But now I feel that interest in America. I miss bookstores that have English-language books in them. I miss big spaces and driving with a window down. I miss being able to be alone all the time in outdoor spaces and all those little suburban parks where maybe three people go in a day and you can just plop on a bench and have it totally to yourself. I miss the clean air the most, that huge breath you can take in the Fall and Winter especially, because that is just not a thing in East Asia.  
But I have no idea now. I'm 33, I don't have a single clue of a skill I could develop toward or what position I should be looking for in America. I haven't done anything--- just six years of dumping around in Asia, and I really loved it for five, but now I feel like there's an even more impossible hurdle to creating a life in my home country than when I initially left. And I guess that should have been obvious, but it wasn't to me. Same with getting tired of this; I really believed that this would always be ""good enough"" until I suddenly got slammed with thoughts otherwise earlier this year.  


I know a lot of people that packed it in after a year or two and, after some adjustment, made it out okay back in America and Canada. But that was back in late 20's--- now, my mid-30's basically, I just don't know what I could be cut out for, or what I could try and work towards.

Yea GFC sucked and the effect lingered for years after. There was also opportunity created like interest unlike any previous generations had seen, decline of housing prices not seen for 30+ years, and first time homebuyers tax credit.

 I remembered being just 1 year into workforce in a bank and see the world around me falls apart. Luckily my job survived because it was so entry level and I was too low cost. Looking back at the time, 2 key decisions were made back then. 

- since upward mobility and even simple raises  were no longer possible, so I applied and lwent back to school at night. 
- get a small condo, and that tax credit helped to push for taking a risk on getting 2 mortgages at the time.

A bill introduced in the House and Senate would prevent hedge funds from owning single-family houses in the United States‚Äîwrite to your senator!,"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/06/realestate/wall-street-housing-market.html

Democrats in Congress have introduced a bill in both houses of Congress on Tuesday to ban hedge funds from buying and owning single-family homes in the United States.

The bill would require hedge funds, defined as corporations, partnerships or real estate investment trusts that manage funds pooled from investors, to sell off all the single-family homes they own over a 10-year period, and eventually prohibit such companies from owning any single-family homes at all. During the decade-long phaseout period, the bill would impose stiff tax penalties, with the proceeds reserved for down-payment assistance for individuals looking to buy homes from corporate owners.

If signed into law, the legislation, called the End Hedge Fund Control of American Homes Act of 2023, could upend a growing sector of the housing market, and potentially increase the supply of single-family homes available for individual buyers. 

In separate legislation, Representatives Jeff Jackson and Alma Adams of North Carolina, both Democrats, introduced the American Neighborhoods Protection Act on Wednesday. That bill would require corporate owners of more than 75 single-family homes to pay an annual fee of $10,000 per home into a housing trust fund to be used as down payment assistance for families.

With a divided Congress, the bills are unlikely to pass into law this session. But Mr. Smith said legislators needed to start a conversation.

The bills were introduced three months after The New York Times published a story examining the impact of corporate-backed investment on Charlotte, N.C., where, in 2022, investors purchased 17 percent of the city‚Äôs homes in cash, often outcompeting first-time buyers who rely heavily on mortgages.

In a pattern repeated in cities around the country, corporations focused on modestly priced houses, frequently in neighborhoods with large Black and Latino populations, and converted the properties to rentals. In one neighborhood in east Charlotte, Wall Street-backed investors bought half of the homes that sold in 2021 and 2022. On one block, all but one home that sold during that period sold in cash to an investor who rented it out.",r/Millennials
Well it finally happened. My rent increased and I am so done.,"I‚Äôve been seeing posts about rent going up astronomically since the pandemic. I have lived in the same apartment complex since 2016, and while rent has gone up a little, it‚Äôs been the most affordable place in my city. Two years ago I got a promotion and we finally, FINALLY had some financial stability. No more food bank, and we could save some, buy nice things for our daughter, and give to less fortunate. The plan was to save what little we could to eventually buy a house. Then the rates went up and priced us out of the housing market. Well, we figured we would just stay in our cheap apartment and keep saving. An investment firm bought our complex this year and now we have been notified that our rent is increasing significantly. We live in a 450sqft apartment, and, starting in February, we will be paying as much or more than a mortgage would have cost before the rate increase. So now it looks like it‚Äôs back to the food bank for us. We are going to be ‚Äúhouse poor‚Äù and not even own a house to show for it. My promotion has been completely wiped out. I am so done.",r/Millennials

"DOOM BREAK: describe your ""typical"" childhood Saturday experience","...maybe we can compare some notes? üòÜ

My childhood Saturday morning circa the mid/late 1990's typically began as I woke up from a ***restful***, ""full"" 7-8 hours of sleep (0 sleep problems back then/insomnia simply wasn't a thing at all and didn't exist yet)... sometimes there would be a slight breeze coming in from the nearby bedroom window (...fresh air, since there was much less traffic back then)

I would get up and mom would already be in the kitchen making breakfast, usually eggs and either bacon/sausage of some kind with mashed beans and tortillas. Sometimes I would eat what she made, but more often (kids being kids) I would opt for a sugary-ass cereal instead üòã

I remember I would get myself a HUGE bowl of sugary cereal and plop myself down on the couch by 9 AM or so to catch the ""latest"" episode of Pokemon and then the ""latest"" episode of Digimon around 10 AM. Sometimes I would add an extra spoonful or two of sugar to it just because 

I distinctly remember slurping down that milky ""sugar water"" towards the bottom of the glass bowl (after the physical cereal had already been eaten) and I remember how it tasted sooooo good

Chowing down on that bigass bowl of sugary cereal on the couch while watching my Saturday morning cartoons without a care or worry in the world in the 90's was just... üëå

By around 11 AM the Saturday morning cartoons segment had sort of ""tapered off"" and the programming had switched to other stuff

By this time my nearby neighborhood school friends had already woken up. We sometimes gathered in the little ""courtyard"" behind my apartment complex to mess around/play outside (kids still randomly played outside back then as smartphones didn't exist yet)

I would spend most of the day either hanging out with my nearby school buddies (in the physical world, since smartphones/social media didn't exist yet), or playing either my Gameboy my Nintendo 64. At the time the internet was still in it's infancy, I vaguely remember visiting (very) early versions of IGN and Gamespot here and there on my ""dialup"" 56k connection and how images were sooooo slow to load

Being the height of the Pokemon era, I remember there was this weird ""hierarchy"" among the school kids. Basically your ""status level"" (for lack of a better word) among the other kids was largely determined by how big your Pokemon card binder was - the kids with the rarest cards and best ""holos"" (short for ""rare"" holographic cards) commanded the most respect and status on the schoolyard, and vice versa (the kids with the more generic/common cards were not as popular). Having a big binder/a bunch of rare cards was basically the childhood version of being the ""popular high school jock"" - those kids were always swimming in friends/attention

Anyways, what was your ""typical"" childhood Saturday like?",r/Millennials

Do you have a favorite radio station? Public radio? Community radio? Commercial radio?,"I‚Äôm a young millennial (29) at the beginning of a career in radio and broadcast journalism. It‚Äôs always been my passion, but I know there have been huge losses in the field (NPR staff cuts, Nat Geo getting rid of their last staff writer, etc) which often get attributed to a lack of interest and a fractured media landscape among younger people.

I don‚Äôt exactly buy that, because when I talk to my friends about how they consume media, it‚Äôs similar to how I do - we listen to local public radio and local community radio all the time. I wanted to expand my sample range, though, and see what other people‚Äôs habits are.

Part of the reason I love radio is that it‚Äôs inherently accessible and community oriented. Even commercial radio stations often feature and uplift local people and organizations and events. There‚Äôs no price barrier - you can tune in with a $3 radio you get at Goodwill, no subscription required. It doesn‚Äôt ask for your data and it has no algorithm. If there is news, it‚Äôs typically oriented around the local first, and most of the nationally syndicated programs are reputable, from APM or NPR or NYT. But the most compelling thing, for me, is that it gives people a common cultural touchstone; I think consuming hyper individualized media on an a la carte basis can be isolating. Having a shared media landscape helps people feel connected.

/soapbox

So, my question is - what‚Äôs your relationship with radio? Do you listen to your local stations? Do you have a favorite show that a local community station hosts (rockabilly? EDM? JPOP?) or do you host a show yourself? I want to hear about how radio does or doesn‚Äôt fit into your life.",r/Millennials
"Miserable millennials, here's a happiness hack: practice random acts of kindness","Humans evolved to be social creatures. Communal living is our survival strategy, so we are programmed to be rewarded for practicing altruism. There is a very real, natural reward to every positive experience you share with every other human. Science has proven people with strong social bonds live longer, happier lives... In fact, loneliness is a cause of dementia. 

Therefore I believe the most important factor that determines your happiness in life is the strength and quality of the relationships you have with other humans. And relationships don't need to huge commitments of time and energy. You can have a positive relationship with a stranger from a simple act of kindness.

Every gesture, no matter how big or small, is ever wasted. A smile to a stranger, a text or call to a friend, a compliment... it is so easy to show kindness, and the benefits never end, for both giver and receiver. This just might be the only exception to the law of diminishing returns.

30 is far from old.

"Is it common to leave the house without ID days, even if you‚Äôre driving?","Something I‚Äôm curious and a tad confused about, wonder if this is strictly a generational thing or just the way I was brought up.

Do you leave the house without ID, even if you‚Äôre driving?

This came up because my building makes delivery people leave their ID with the security guard at the front desk to get a fob for the elevator to reach a resident‚Äôs door. Several times in the past few months, I had to go downstairs because the DoorDash driver said they didn‚Äôt bring their ID. Not a big deal most of the time.

But then it hit me, wait, they‚Äôre driving without license on hand? And this happened quite a bit with different drivers, so this seems common.

I‚Äôm from NYC so I last drove in the Bush years lmao, otherwise had a nondriver ID card since. Most of my family who never drove had them too.

And my parents always stressed that you shouldn‚Äôt leave without your ID, keep it in your wallet, but ESPECIALLY if you drove because you‚Äôd be in deep shit if you got pulled over without it.

So in light of my not driving and thus lacking frame of reference‚Äîare licenses just on your phone now?

For instance, when I was in elementary a kid called me ‚ÄúGay‚Äù derisively for wearing an Orange Shirt. Ever since then I never wore the color orange because I didn‚Äôt want to be picked on. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",r/Millennials
Hot Millennial trash TV shows that have pandered to millennials in the past couple of years.,"Alright folks. I just got finished watching a hot Millennial trash TV show (I don't have any other way to describe the horrors) that seem to be doing everything in its power to pander to my millennial sensitivities! Anybody here watch Twisted Metal? It's a new show created using elements of the 90's game of the same name. It did everything right. So much so that I forwarded to the parts I liked. Mainly the parts with the clown guy causing chaos. 

My (core) question to you folks is: what new show have you seen lately that has done EVERYTHING in its power to pander to your...millenialish sensibilities? What new millennial tropes have you seen in a show lately? I need shows to fast forward through.",r/Millennials
Anyone else big on counting their steps these days? *60 character limit I spose*,"I downloaded Samsung Health on my phone last year in the spring so I been monitoring my steps since then. I have a daily step goal of at least 6,000 and average 9,405 a day. If I notice at some point my number is low that day I try to make an extra effort to go up and down my stairs as much as possible lol 

 Walking is one of those things I dont wanna take for granted. I love walking but I got a bad ankle with a tendon injury that will eventually need surgery. I have to wear a brace for it. Surgery is like 4-6 weeks of bedrest and then using a boot for a few weeks or so. I am going to be miserable as fuck whenever that happens. Might as well take advantage of walking while I can",r/Millennials
What do you all recommend that I do when it comes to this Christmas gift situation with my sister's family?,"I have a sister, who is married with 3 kids. For the past 15 years, wife and I have never gotten a thank you, gift in return, a card, or even acknowledgement for Christmas presents we've sent her family.

My parents always have excuses for my sister. It's a lifelong thing, and there's always a reason why I am to blame when I bring up her problems. It was like opening the gates of hell when my wife and I wanted to gift her kids some form of savings bond or a share of stock for Christmas years ago. We were met with being told that it was a selfish thing to do, and that we must buy her kids toys.

The only time we got any form of thank you was one time years ago. It happened because I mentioned to my parents that we never get thank yous and don't feel like we should bother sending anything anymore. A week later we got half-assed thank you cards from her kids. You could tell it was begrudgingly done.

The last time we were in the same place as her family for Christmas, we had gifts for her family. We typically mail gifts. But the last time in person, we were met with ""Is that it? Where are the rest of the presents? Only this?"" Coming from my sister, her husband, and kids.

We don't live in the same part of the USA, and family problems have made it that we don't visit where they live.

Asking for opinions on a couple options, or if you have a better idea...

1. Donate money to an organization like the SPCA in her family's name.
2. Just quietly don't send anything to her family at all.
3. Send a gift card to some place they can do something together as a family. (Mini-golf, bowling, etc)

Not interested in discussing it any further with my parents or sister, as I am always to blame. Thanks in advance for your opinions!",r/Millennials

"To all my independent millennials, How are y‚Äôall making it on your own right now?","No but really? lol. With the way inflation is now, I just wonder how other ppl around my age and up (28) are making it. 

For a little context, I‚Äôm a CNA. I started doing travel contracts last year within my state making sufficient money for just me (5k a month). I ended up moving into an apartment that was $1300 a month and eventually my financials became too unstable. (Healthcare facilities cut back on travelers while simultaneously decreasing our pay due to Covid not being a major threat anymore.. I guess). Anyways I was fortunate enough to be able to fall back on family and move in with a family member.

I really do miss living alone though. How are you guys doing it? üò≠. What‚Äôs the secret? Sometimes I wonder should I have finished college but it seems like a good amount of millennials who went to college are still struggling too. Btw, I don‚Äôt plan on being a CNA forever or even staying in the healthcare field.",r/Millennials

What do you think life will be like for millenials once we get beyond our 70's?,"I think we'll be fucked once we all start getting alzheimer's and dementia. Think about how hard it is right now to remember all your online passwords for all your different things at the moment. Now think about how hard it will be for us to remember any of that shit once we start getting Alzheimer's and dementia.
I'm also pretty sure people will be using AI to pretend to be loved ones to get money from us (although that will most likely start happening within the next 5 to 10 years).
I also think by then biotechnology will also be super advanced. I can can see myself when I'm 80 as basically a brain in a robot, sort of like Krang from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, or some version of RoboCop.
Im curious how late the retirement age will eventually get to since our generation isn't having kids at the same rate at generations before us. What happens when the amount of retired people outnumber the amount of working people by a huge amount? Will technology balance things out to keep us alive or will society crumble into some sort of Mad Max style apocalypse. How much thought do you guys put into your skills that would be valid after an apocalypse?

Jeez Team - Why the Negativity? Let‚Äôs Hear Something Positive.,"Was excited to join this sub recently, expecting a wave of nostalgia &amp; positivity, but have seen mostly vitriol towards our forebearers, a lot of gloom &amp; doom, &amp; negative outlooks.

Am 35M down in crazy Florida &amp; feel like this is the best time to ever live in human history. Many of my similarly aged peers are also thriving with their careers, family-building, all things considered.

Are Reddit Millennials just this collectively cynical? Let's hear something good!",r/Millennials

Millennial Aunts and Uncles: How many of you feel like you are ‚Äústand-in‚Äù grandparents?,"I‚Äôm a 43 year old elder Millennial and proud uncle of 8 kiddos ranging from 3-13. I don‚Äôt have any kids of my own.

My parents are Boomers (69 and 72) and they have largely shrugged off their grandparent duties for at least six months a year while they live it up in Central Florida as snowbirds. Even when they‚Äôre home the kids tend to overwhelm them and they just sit in their recliners and play on their phones and iPads and wait for the kids to leave. 

As a result of this, I‚Äôve largely stepped into more of a grandparent role doing things like babysitting, picking the kids up when their parents need help, going to ballgames and Christmas programs, taking the kids on special one on one days for trips into the city for parks and museums and shows and other things like that, and just being that secondary adult figure in their lives. I love it and wouldn‚Äôt trade it for the world. Those kids give way more to me than I ever give to them. 

Part of me feels some resentment that my parents aren‚Äôt playing the same role my grandparents played in my life but I also am grateful that I have the time and resources to spoil the kiddos and be a big part of their lives. Is anyone else noticing this trend with our Boomer parents? I feel like they are far less engaged and involved with grandkids than our grandparents were, but it could also be a generational bias. Who knows. 

Just wanted to see if I‚Äôm the only one or if others are experiencing/feeling this as well.",r/Millennials
